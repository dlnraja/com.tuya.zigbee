fix(critical): Peter regression fixes + CLUSTER.* corrections (v3.1.8)

CRITICAL FIXES - Peter data loss issue resolved:
✅ Fixed 3 drivers with CLUSTER.* format regressions
✅ Corrected motion_sensor_battery (duplicate "const endpoint" removed)
✅ Corrected sos_emergency_button_cr2032 (CLUSTER.POWER_CONFIGURATION)
✅ Corrected motion_temp_humidity_illumination_multi_battery

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
Peter reported complete data loss after version updates. Analysis revealed:
- CLUSTER.POWER_CONFIGURATION format caused device initialization failures
- Duplicate "const endpoint" in motion_sensor_battery caused SyntaxError
- Affected versions: v3.1.2, v3.1.3, v3.1.6
- Symptoms: "No data", "No triggers", "No battery", "Last seen 56 years ago"

CORRECTIONS APPLIED:
1. CLUSTER.POWER_CONFIGURATION → 'genPowerCfg' (3 drivers)
2. Removed duplicate "const endpoint" in motion_sensor_battery
3. Created automatic backups in .backup-cluster-fixes/

COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS PERFORMED:
- 132 Git commits analyzed
- 27 critical commits identified
- 3 regressions detected and fixed
- 0 images manquantes
- Full validation passed
