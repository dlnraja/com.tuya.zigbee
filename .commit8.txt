Bump version to 4.1.3 to resolve GitHub Actions conflict

FIX: Version conflict in GitHub Actions workflow
- Updated app.json version from 4.1.0 to 4.1.3
- Resolves "Version conflict detected" error
- Required due to existing tags: v4.1.0, 4.1.1, 4.1.2

This should allow the GitHub Actions workflow to complete successfully.
