Fix GitHub Actions failure - optimize driver search engine

ISSUE:
- GitHub Actions failed due to large drivers-database.json file (544KB)
- Build timeout or memory issue during publication

SOLUTION:
- Removed static JSON database file
- Implemented client-side generation using Homey.getDrivers() API
- Search engine now builds index dynamically from app data
- Reduced app package size significantly

BENEFITS:
- No large static files in repository
- Always up-to-date driver list
- Faster builds and deployments
- No GitHub Actions timeout issues

TECHNICAL:
- Settings page now uses Homey API to fetch driver data
- Client-side categorization and brand extraction
- Same search functionality, better performance
