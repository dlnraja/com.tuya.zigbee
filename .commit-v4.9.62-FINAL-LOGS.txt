feat(CRITICAL): v4.9.62 - FINAL defensive logs (v4.9.61 had NONE!)

CRITICAL ISSUE:
v4.9.60 and v4.9.61 were auto-incremented WITHOUT defensive logs!
This version RE-ADDS all console.log defensive logging.

USER DIAGNOSTIC v4.9.61:
- stdout: n/a
- stderr: n/a  
- NO LOGS AT ALL captured!
- User reports: 2 USB devices + 1 PIR sensor show as "ZIGBEE inconnue"

DEFENSIVE LOGS RE-ADDED:
‚úÖ console.log() at EVERY critical step
‚úÖ Try-catch around ALL operations  
‚úÖ Safe data checks before use
‚úÖ Skip if no data (no crash)
‚úÖ Emoji markers for visibility

LOG MARKERS:
üö® [DEVICE START] - ALWAYS appears if device init
üîç [IDENTITY] - Device identity check
‚úÖ [INIT] - Defaults set
‚ö° [AVAILABILITY] - setAvailable()
üîÑ [BACKGROUND] - Background init started
‚úÖ [COMPLETE] - onNodeInit complete

WHY v4.9.61 HAD NO LOGS:
- Auto-increment system incremented version
- But didn't include my defensive logging changes
- Need to ensure logs are in THIS version

RESPONSE TO USER:
- RESPONSE_USER_v4.9.61.md created
- Asks for new diagnostic after restart + 120s wait
- Requests Zigbee info screenshots for unknown devices
- Will add manufacturer IDs for USB + PIR devices

FILES:
- app.json: v4.9.62
- lib/BaseHybridDevice.js: ALL defensive logs present
- RESPONSE_USER_v4.9.61.md: User response template

NEXT DIAGNOSTIC SHOULD SHOW:
Either console.log markers OR confirm platform issue
