## [2.1.40] - 2025-10-10

### üêõ Critical Bug Fixes (Forum Community)

#### Bug #259 - Temperature/Humidity Sensor Not Showing Values (@Karsten_Hille)
- **Fixed**: Temperature and humidity values now display correctly
- **Fixed**: Removed incorrect motion sensor detection
- **Cleaned**: Removed `alarm_motion` and `measure_luminance` capabilities from temp/humidity driver
- **Optimized**: Manufacturer IDs separated by device type (removed button and motion sensor IDs)
- **Enhanced**: Proper attribute reporting configuration (temp, humidity, battery)
- **Corrected**: Zigbee clusters to 1026 (temperature) and 1029 (humidity)

#### Bug #256 - PIR/Buttons Showing as "Unknown Zigbee Device" (@Cam)
- **Fixed**: PIR motion sensors now pair correctly without conflicts
- **Cleaned**: Removed overlapping manufacturer IDs between drivers
- **Separated**: Motion sensor IDs from temperature sensor IDs
- **Optimized**: Product IDs reduced to only TS0202 for PIR sensors
- **Improved**: Device recognition during pairing process

#### Bug #261 - Add Gas Sensor Support (@ugrbnk)
- **Added**: Support for TS0601_gas_sensor_2 variants
- **Enriched**: 5 new manufacturer IDs for gas sensors
  - `_TZE200_ezqy5pvh`, `_TZE204_ezqy5pvh`
  - `_TZE200_ggev5fsl`, `_TZE204_ggev5fsl`
  - `_TZE284_rjgdhqqi`

### üîß Technical Improvements
- **Validation**: Homey CLI validation passes at `publish` level
- **SDK3**: Full compliance with Homey SDK3 guidelines
- **Zigbee**: Correct cluster configuration per device type
