### ✅ RÉPONSE À ENVOYER

Hi!

Thank you for submitting the diagnostic report! I've identified and FIXED the critical bug causing the exclamation marks on your button devices.

🔍 PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
The app contained 102 obsolete flow cards from the old button driver naming system (button_1gang, button_2gang, etc.). After the v4.5.0 unbranded migration, these drivers were renamed to button_wireless_* and button_remote_*, but the old flow card references remained in the compiled app.json file. This caused all button drivers to crash during initialization with "Invalid Flow Card ID: button_pressed" errors.

✅ FIX APPLIED:
- Removed all 102 obsolete flow cards
- Validated the app at publish level
- All button drivers now initialize correctly
- No more exclamation marks!

🚀 SOLUTION:
The fix has been pushed to GitHub and will be auto-published as v4.5.1 within the next few hours. Once the update is available:
1. Update the Universal Tuya Zigbee app to v4.5.1
2. Restart Homey (optional but recommended)
3. Your button devices should work perfectly!

Your existing devices will continue to work seamlessly - the manufacturer IDs were preserved during the migration.

Please let me know if the issue persists after updating to v4.5.1!

Best regards,
Dylan

## 📋 DIAGNOSTIC 3 - ZEMISMART SENSOR WRONG CAPABILITIES

**Diagnostic ID:** 1220a7cf-f467-4b3d-a432-446a2858134b  
**User Issue:** "Zemismart sensor - Temperature sensor does not measure Temp or Humidity (believes it has a motion sensor)"  
**App Version:** v4.3.8  
**Error:** No crash, but wrong driver/capabilities

Hi!

Thank you for the diagnostic report! I can see your temperature/humidity sensor is incorrectly detecting motion sensor capabilities instead of temperature and humidity.

🔍 PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
This is a different issue from the button driver crashes. It appears your device is being paired with an incorrect driver or the device firmware is reporting unexpected capabilities. The diagnostic shows your device initialized successfully, but with the wrong capability set.

📝 TO HELP ME FIX THIS, PLEASE PROVIDE:
1. **Device Model**: What's the exact model/brand of your temperature sensor?
2. **Manufacturer ID**: You can find this in the device's advanced settings
3. **Current Driver**: Which driver is it currently using in Homey?
4. **Expected Capabilities**: Temperature, Humidity, and any others?

🔧 TEMPORARY WORKAROUND:
Try re-pairing the device:
1. Remove the device from Homey
2. Reset the device (usually hold button for 5+ seconds until LED flashes)
3. Add it again and select the correct driver when prompted
4. Look for drivers named "Climate Monitor" or "Temperature Sensor" rather than "Motion Sensor"

If you can provide the information above, I'll ensure the correct manufacturer IDs are mapped to the appropriate driver in the next update!

Best regards,
Dylan
