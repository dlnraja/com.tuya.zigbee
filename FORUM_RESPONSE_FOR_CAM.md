# Response to Cam - Red Error Triangles Fixed

## Hi Cam! 👋

I've just pushed v2.15.83 which **fixes the red error triangles** you reported!

---

## 🐛 What was the problem?

The v2.15.81 IAS Zone fix accidentally created **duplicate code with syntax errors** in 5 drivers:
1. SOS Emergency Button (sos_emergency_button_cr2032)
2. Motion Temp Humidity Sensor (motion_temp_humidity_illumination_multi_battery)
3. PIR Radar Illumination Sensor
4. Door/Window Sensor
5. Water Leak Sensor

This duplicate code caused **broken braces** which made Homey show red error triangles on the devices.

---

## ✅ What's been fixed in v2.15.83?

- ✅ Removed all duplicate IAS Zone enrollment code
- ✅ Fixed all syntax errors (closed all braces properly)
- ✅ Cleaned up the code structure
- ✅ Both SOS button and Motion sensor will now load correctly
- ✅ No more red triangles!

---

## 📝 How to fix your devices (IMPORTANT!)

The devices need to be **re-paired** after updating to v2.15.83:

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Update the app** to v2.15.83 in Homey App Store
2. **Remove both devices** from Homey:
   - SOS Emergency Button
   - Motion Temp Humidity Sensor
3. **Put fresh batteries** in both devices (important!)
4. **Re-pair** both devices in Homey
5. **Test**:
   - Press the SOS button → Should trigger `alarm_generic`
   - Wave hand in front of motion sensor → Should trigger `alarm_motion`

---

## 🔧 Technical Details (for your reference)

The fix removed this duplicate code block that was accidentally inserted inside the battery capability registration:

```javascript
// This duplicate code (lines 90-149) has been removed:
// ========================================
// IAS ZONE ENROLLMENT - SDK3 FIXED
// ========================================
// (duplicate enrollment code that broke the syntax)
```

The **correct** IAS Zone enrollment code remains in the file (the original implementation), which uses:
- ✅ `zclNode.bridgeId` for Homey IEEE address (SDK3 correct)
- ✅ Proper zoneStatusChangeNotification listener
- ✅ Flow card triggers when button pressed or motion detected

---

## 📊 What you should see after re-pairing:

### SOS Emergency Button:
- ✅ No red error triangle
- ✅ Battery percentage shows correctly
- ✅ Pressing button triggers `alarm_generic` = true
- ✅ Flow card `alarm_triggered` fires
- ✅ Auto-resets after 5 seconds

### Motion Temp Humidity Sensor:
- ✅ No red error triangle  
- ✅ Temperature, humidity, luminance all update
- ✅ Motion detection works correctly
- ✅ Flow card `motion_detected` fires with tokens (luminance, temp, humidity)
- ✅ `motion_cleared` fires when motion stops

---

## 🎯 Testing checklist:

After re-pairing, please test:

**SOS Button**:
- [ ] Device shows no red triangle
- [ ] Battery percentage displays correctly
- [ ] Press button → alarm turns ON
- [ ] Alarm auto-resets after 5 seconds
- [ ] Flow triggers work in automation

**Motion Sensor**:
- [ ] Device shows no red triangle
- [ ] Temperature updates (check current value)
- [ ] Humidity updates
- [ ] Luminance updates
- [ ] Wave hand → motion detected
- [ ] Motion clears after ~60 seconds
- [ ] Flow triggers work in automation

## 📧 Response to your questions:

> "I don't see this option"

Which option were you looking for? If it was related to flows or settings, v2.15.82 added **82 flow cards total** including:
- `alarm_triggered` for SOS button
- `motion_detected` for motion sensors
- Many capability-based flows

After updating to v2.15.83 and re-pairing, all these flows should be available.

> "Should I wait until you've fixed the temp humidity sensor driver?"

✅ **It's fixed now!** v2.15.83 cleaned up the code completely. The motion_temp_humidity_illumination_multi_battery driver will load without errors.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps:

1. **Wait for v2.15.83** to appear in Homey App Store (usually takes a few hours)
2. **Update the app**
3. **Re-pair devices** following the steps above
4. **Test** and let me know if everything works!

---

## 💬 If you still have issues:

If after re-pairing you still see problems, please:
1. Send another diagnostic report
2. Include the device name that's having issues
3. Describe what happens when you press the SOS button or trigger motion

I'm actively monitoring the forum and will help immediately!

## 🎊 Thank you!

Thank you so much for reporting this issue! Your feedback helps make the app better for everyone.

The red triangles should be completely gone in v2.15.83 after re-pairing.

Let me know how it goes! 👍
