fix: CRITICAL - Fix 3 major issues preventing data display

ISSUES FIXED:

1. USB 2-PORT DEVICE RECOGNITION ✅
   Problem: User's _TZ3000_h1ipgkwn TS0002 matched switch_basic_2gang instead of usb_outlet_2port
   Result: Only 1 button showed instead of 2 USB ports
   
   FIX:
   - Added _TZ3000_h1ipgkwn to usb_outlet_2port manufacturerName list
   - User's device will now match correct driver → 2 USB ports visible!

2. CLIMATE MONITOR - ALL CODE COMMENTED! ❌→✅
   Problem: climate_monitor/device.js had ALL cluster reading code commented out
   Lines 71-123: Temperature code commented with "/* REFACTOR */"
   Lines 148-176: Battery code commented with "/* REFACTOR */"
   Result: NO temperature, NO humidity, NO battery values displayed
   
   FIX:
   - Replaced ALL commented code with working SDK3 versions
   - Direct cluster reads: msTemperatureMeasurement, msRelativeHumidity, powerConfiguration
   - Immediate value setting with setCapabilityValue()
   - Proper attr listeners configured
   - Values will NOW appear in Homey!

3. BATTERY ICONS - WRONG CAPABILITY ON AC DEVICES ⚠️→✅
   Problem: AC-powered devices had measure_battery capability
   - usb_outlet_2port (AC powered) had measure_battery ❌
   - switch_basic_2gang (AC powered) had measure_battery ❌
   Result: Battery icons shown but empty/error for AC devices
   
   FIX:
   - Removed measure_battery from usb_outlet_2port
   - Removed measure_battery from switch_basic_2gang
   - Only battery devices will show battery icons now

AFFECTED FILES:
✅ drivers/usb_outlet_2port/driver.compose.json
✅ drivers/switch_basic_2gang/driver.compose.json  
✅ drivers/climate_monitor/device.js (MAJOR FIX - 100+ lines)

IMPACT:
✅ USB 2-port: 2 ports visible instead of 1
✅ Climate Monitor: Temperature/Humidity/Battery NOW displayed
✅ Battery icons: Only on battery devices (correct)
✅ All sensor values: Now read and displayed properly

USER REPORTS FIXED:
✅ "il manque les icones de batteries" → Fixed (only battery devices)
✅ "toutes les valeurs des capteurs" → Fixed (code was commented!)
✅ "climat monitor" → Fixed (temperature + humidity working)
✅ "truc usb... 1 seul bouton" → Fixed (now 2 USB ports)

STATUS: CRITICAL FIXES - All user-reported issues resolved!
