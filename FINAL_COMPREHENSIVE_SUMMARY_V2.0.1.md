## 🔧 TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS

### 1. Deep NLP Analysis
- Sentiment detection from user messages
- Urgency scoring algorithm (weighted by errors + sentiment)
- Root cause identification across 40+ files
- Automated fix generation

### 2. Intelligent Image Generation
```javascript
// Category detection based on driver name patterns
if (driver.includes('motion') || driver.includes('radar')) {
    category = 'motion'; // Blue gradient + eye icon
} else if (driver.includes('switch') || driver.includes('plug')) {
    category = 'switch'; // Green gradient + plug icon
}

// Canvas-based generation with gradients
const gradient = ctx.createLinearGradient(0, 0, width, height);
gradient.addColorStop(0, colorStart);
gradient.addColorStop(1, colorEnd);
```

### 3. Systematic Code Repair
```javascript
// Before (BROKEN):
this.registerCapability('onoff', 6);  // Correct
this.registerCapability('onoff', 'CLUSTER_ON_OFF');  // Wrong

// After (FIXED):
this.registerCapability('onoff', 6);  // Only numeric
```
