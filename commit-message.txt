feat(sdk3): Fix all sensor data visibility in Homey + Complete migration

CRITICAL FIX: 35 drivers with invisible sensor data corrected
- All measure_temperature/humidity/luminance/co2 now visible in Homey
- Complete SDK3 configuration with numeric cluster IDs
- Attribute reporting properly configured with optimal intervals

Sensor Capabilities Fixed (35 drivers):
- measure_temperature (cluster 1026) - 34 drivers fixed
- measure_humidity (cluster 1029) - 21 drivers fixed
- measure_luminance (cluster 1024) - 3 drivers fixed
- measure_co2 (cluster 1037) - 1 driver fixed

Fixed Drivers Include:
- air_quality_* (comprehensive, monitor, pm25)
- climate_* (monitor_co2, sensor_soil, sensor_temp_humidity_advanced)
- motion_sensor_* (multi with temp/humidity/lux, pir_radar)
- presence_sensor_radar (luminance)
- hvac_* (air_conditioner, dehumidifier)
- radiator_valve* (basic, smart)
- smoke_detector_* (climate, temp_humidity)
- thermostat_* (advanced, smart, temperature_control)
- wall_touch_* (1-8 gang with temperature sensors)
- water_* (leak_sensor, valve_smart, valve_smart_hybrid)
- temperature_sensor (basic, advanced)
- humidity_controller

USB Outlets Complete Migration:
- usb_outlet_1gang: Full power measurement SDK3
- usb_outlet_2port: Multi-endpoint dual control
- usb_outlet_3gang: 3-endpoint + aggregate power
- usb_outlet_advanced: Verified SDK3 compliant
- usb_outlet_basic: Verified SDK3 compliant

Climate Monitor Enhancement:
- Multi-protocol battery detection (Zigbee/Tuya/Xiaomi)
- Time/date sync to device screen (auto-update every 1h)
- Backlight button control with configurable duration
- Already properly configured (verified working)

SDK3 Implementation Details:
- 100% numeric cluster IDs (no CLUSTER constants)
- Proper reportParser with unit conversion
- Optimal reporting intervals (60s min to 1h max)
- Error handling with .catch() on all promises
- getOnStart: true for immediate initial values

Reporting Configuration:
- Temperature: 1min-1h intervals, 0.1C change threshold
- Humidity: 1min-1h intervals, 1% change threshold
- Luminance: 1min-1h intervals, adaptive threshold
- CO2: 5min-1h intervals, 10ppm change threshold

Scripts Created:
- scripts/fixes/FIX_ALL_SENSOR_CAPABILITIES.js (auto-fix tool)
- scripts/validation/SDK3_COMPREHENSIVE_VALIDATION.js

Documentation Created:
- docs/SDK3_COMPREHENSIVE_MIGRATION_PLAN.md (500+ lines)
- docs/SDK3_MIGRATION_SESSION_SUMMARY.md (400+ lines)
- DEPLOYMENT_READY.md (production checklist)

Validation Results:
- homey app validate --level publish: PASSED
- Total drivers enhanced: 41 (35 sensors + 6 USB/climate)
- Zero validation errors
- Zero critical warnings
- Production ready

Impact: All sensor data now properly visible in Homey interface
