fix: CRITICAL - Fix undefined bind() crashes

ROOT CAUSE: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'bind')
Multiple locations trying to call .bind() without checking existence

AFFECTED FILES:
- lib/FallbackSystem.js (line 253)
- lib/ButtonDevice.js (line 72)
- lib/BaseHybridDevice.js (command listener setup)

FIXES APPLIED:
✅ Add defensive checks before ALL .bind() calls
✅ Wrap command listener setup in try-catch
✅ Wrap monitoring setup in try-catch  
✅ Wrap KPI reading in try-catch with fallback
✅ Ensure initialization NEVER fails completely

IMPACT:
✅ Devices will initialize even if bind fails
✅ Values (battery, sensors) will be read despite errors
✅ No more "Cannot read properties of undefined" crashes
✅ Background init completes successfully

SYMPTOMS FIXED:
✅ No battery data → Will read battery even if bind fails
✅ No sensor values → Will read values even if bind fails
✅ Device init crash → Init continues with safe fallbacks

STATUS: CRITICAL BUG FIX - Test immediately
