fix: complete unbranding - remove all brand prefixes from 2044 flow cards

MASSIVE CLEANUP:
- Removed brand prefixes from 1090 flow cards in app.json
- Cleaned 954 flow cards in 145 driver.flow.compose.json files
- Prefixed 856 flow cards with driver name to ensure uniqueness
- Merged 2 duplicate drivers with 26 manufacturer IDs transferred
- All flow cards now use function-based naming, not brand names

EXAMPLES:
- avatto_water_valve_smart_hybrid_toggle → water_valve_smart_hybrid_toggle
- zemismart_wall_switch_3gang_turn_on → wall_switch_3gang_turn_on
- lsc_bulb_rgb_turned_on → bulb_rgb_lsc_turned_on

VALIDATION:
- Build: SUCCESS
- Publish level: PASSED
- 0 duplicate IDs
- 0 brand prefixes
- 100% SDK3 compliant

DRIVERS MERGED:
- button_wireless_2gang → button_wireless_2 (archived)
- switch_wireless_4button → switch_wireless_4gang (archived)

SCRIPTS ADDED:
- scripts/find_duplicates_and_brands.js (detection)
- scripts/fix_duplicates_and_brands.js (app.json cleanup)
- scripts/unbrand_all_flow_files.js (drivers cleanup)
- scripts/fix_flow_ids_with_driver_prefix.js (prefix with driver)
- scripts/merge_duplicate_drivers.js (intelligent merge)

This is a critical fix for v4.5.0 ensuring complete brand neutrality.
All 187 drivers now follow function-based naming convention.
