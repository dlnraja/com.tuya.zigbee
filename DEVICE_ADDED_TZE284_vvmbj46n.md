## 📦 Driver Assignment

### Driver Selected
**`temp_humid_sensor_advanced_battery`**

### Why This Driver?
1. ✅ **Tuya Cluster Support**: Uses `TuyaClusterHandler` to handle custom 0xEF00 cluster
2. ✅ **Auto-Detection**: Automatically detects as `MULTI_SENSOR` type
3. ✅ **Standard Datapoints**: Supports DP 2, 4, 5 out-of-the-box
4. ✅ **Fallback Logic**: Falls back to standard Zigbee if Tuya cluster unavailable

### Driver Path
```

## 🧪 Testing Instructions for User

### Karsten_Hille - Please Test

1. **Update the App**
   - Wait for v2.15.93 to appear in Homey App Store (auto-published via GitHub Actions)
   - Update "Universal Tuya Zigbee" app in Homey

2. **Remove Old Device**
   - If device currently appears as "Generic Zigbee Device", remove it from Homey
   - Reset the sensor (usually long press on button)

3. **Add Device**
   - Go to: Settings → Devices → Add Device
   - Search for: **"Temperature Humidity Sensor (Battery)"**
   - Select driver: **"Temperature & Humidity Sensor (Battery)"**
   - Put sensor in pairing mode (usually long press button until LED blinks)

4. **Verify Functionality**
   - ✅ Temperature readings appear and update
   - ✅ Humidity readings appear and update
   - ✅ Battery level shows correctly
   - ✅ Values update automatically (may take 1-60 minutes)

5. **Report Back**
   - If working: Great! Device is now supported ✅
   - If not working: Provide new diagnostic report with exact issue

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### "Device still shows as Generic Zigbee"
**Cause**: Old app version or cache  
**Solution**: 
1. Update app to v2.15.93
2. Restart Homey
3. Remove and re-pair device

### "Temperature/Humidity not updating"
**Cause**: Tuya cluster not receiving reports  
**Solution**:
1. Check device logs: Developer Tools → Devices → [Your Sensor] → Logs
2. Look for: `[TuyaCluster] Raw data received`
3. If no data after 10 minutes, try:
   - Power cycle the sensor (remove/reinsert battery)
   - Move sensor closer to Homey
   - Check battery level

### "Wrong values displayed"
**Cause**: Datapoint mismatch  
**Solution**: Provide logs showing:
```
[TuyaCluster] Raw data received: {...}
[TuyaCluster] 📦 DataPoints received: {...}
```

## 📊 Device Interview Analysis

### Endpoint 1 Clusters
| Cluster ID | Name | Purpose |
|------------|------|---------|
| 0 | basic | Device info |
| 4 | groups | Group membership |
| 5 | scenes | Scene support |
| 61184 | Tuya (0xEF00) | **Primary data** |
| 60672 | Tuya Ext (0xED00) | Extended features |

### Missing Standard Clusters
❌ `1026` (Temperature Measurement)  
❌ `1029` (Humidity Measurement)

**Result**: Device uses **Tuya custom datapoints only**, not standard Zigbee clusters. This is why it appeared as "Generic Zigbee Device" before - it needs Tuya-specific handling.

---

## 🎉 Expected Behavior After Fix

### Before (v2.15.92 and earlier)
- ❌ Device shows as "Generic Zigbee Device"
- ❌ No temperature/humidity readings
- ❌ No driver recognition

### After (v2.15.93+)
- ✅ Recognized as "Temperature & Humidity Sensor (Battery)"
- ✅ Temperature readings in °C
- ✅ Humidity readings in %
- ✅ Battery level in %
- ✅ Automatic updates via Tuya cluster
- ✅ Settings available for calibration

**Subject**: TZE284_vvmbj46n Color LCD Sensor - ADDED in v2.15.93

Hi Karsten,

Great news! Your **Color LCD Temperature & Humidity Sensor** (`_TZE284_vvmbj46n / TS0601`) has been added to the app in **v2.15.93**.

### What Was the Issue?
Your device uses Tuya's custom cluster (0xEF00) instead of standard Zigbee temperature/humidity clusters. This means it needs special handling through the `TuyaClusterHandler`, which is why it appeared as "Generic Zigbee Device" before.

### Solution Applied
I've added your device to the `temp_humid_sensor_advanced_battery` driver, which:
- ✅ Handles Tuya custom datapoints (DP 2, 4, 5)
- ✅ Auto-detects as MULTI_SENSOR type
- ✅ Properly parses temperature (÷10), humidity, and battery

### Next Steps for You
1. **Wait** for v2.15.93 to publish (auto-deploys via GitHub Actions, ~15-30 min)
2. **Update** the app in Homey App Store
3. **Remove** the current "Generic Zigbee Device"
4. **Re-pair** as "Temperature & Humidity Sensor (Battery)"
5. **Verify** temperature, humidity, and battery readings work
6. **Report back** on GitHub issue #1175 with results

### Testing
After pairing, check the device logs in Developer Tools to confirm:
```
[TuyaCluster] ✅ Tuya cluster found on endpoint 1
[TuyaCluster] 📦 DataPoints received: {"2":XX,"4":YYY,"5":ZZ}
```

If you see this, the device is working correctly! Temperature will be `YYY ÷ 10` °C, humidity will be `ZZ` %.

Let me know how it goes! Thanks for providing the device interview - it made adding support straightforward.

Best regards,
