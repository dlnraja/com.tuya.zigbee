        "body": "### Does the issue really belong here?\n\n- [x] I definitively want to report a bug within deCONZ or its REST-API\n\n### Is there already an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues and there is none for the bug at hand\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nLooking into alarm systems (at the request of one of my Homebridge deCONZ users), I found a number of bugs, inconsistencies and shortcomings.  I'll use this issue to document them, hopefully being able to submit one or more PRs to address these.\n\n#### Bugs\n1. The API for `/alarmsystems` doesn't report errors correctly.\n2. The API allows linking unsupported devices, i.e. devices that would never trigger an alarm.\n3. The web sockets notifications for `/alarmsystems` don't honour `websocketnotifyall`.\n4. Currently supported _IAS ACE_ devices expose _IAS Zone_ (0x0500) and _IAS ACE_ (0x0501) on a single `ZHAAncillaryControl` resource.  This causes `state/lastupdated` to be updated when the _IAS Zone_ sends a supervision report, causing API clients to see ghost button presses.\n5. The alarm system doesn't send _Panel Status Changed_ commands to linked _IAS ACE_ devices when its `state` changes.  Instead, it relies on the _IAS ACE_ device to issue a _Panel Status Request_.  I find the frient Intelligent Keypad only sends this command when it's woken up by proximity or pressing a button, not even periodically.  Consequenly, the panel will not reflect status changed caused by others, like the alarm triggering, entry delays, exit delays when the alarm system is armed through the API or by another linked _IAS ACE_ device.  I think this is the cause of #5809.\n6. As ancillary control device implements the **client** _IAS ACE_ cluster, it has no persistent state.  Like `state/buttonevent` for a `ZHASwitch`, `state/action` reflects the last button pressed (see also 4).  The `state/panel` and `state/seconds_remaining` items are copies of the corresponding `state` items of the alarm system, not state items of the control device.  In particular, `state/lastupdated` shouldn't be (and, luckily, currently isn't) be updated when any of these items changes.\n7. The use of `ZHAAncillaryControl` devices is limited to alarm systems.  The  panel items, `state/panel` and `state/seconds_remaining` cannot be updated directly through the API (but they can be updated through the GUI by sending a _Panel Status Changed_ command).  The entered PIN code is not exposed (unlike Z2M).\n\n#### Omissions\n8. The alarm system does not support the following sensors (corresponding to _IAS Zone_ devices): `ZHAAlarm`, `ZHACarbonMonoxide`, `ZHAFire`, `ZHAWater`) and doesn't trigger alarm on the associated items `RStateAlarm`, `RStateCarbonMonoxide`, `RStateFire`, `RStateWater`.  Additionally it doesn't trigger the alarm on `RStateTampered` and `RStateTest`.\n9. The alarm system doesn't support other sensors that report a measured value (like `ZHACarbonDioxide`, but also `ZHATemperature`, `ZHAHumudiy`, etc).  However, for these we would need a configurable range of \"normal\" values.  The alarm would trigger when the measured value falls outside this range.  Note that you would want a range instead of a threshold, e.g. to check that the fridge doesn't get too warm.\n10. The alarm system doesn't support linking _IAS WD_ devices.  Consequently, you need to setup rules to sound the siren when the alarm has been triggered.\n\n### Steps to reproduce the behavior\n\n#### Ad 1 - wrong API error reporting:\nWhen specifying an invalid attribute:\n```\n$ deconz put -v /alarmsystems/1/config '{\"code\": \"1234\"}'\ndeconz put: request 1: PUT /alarmsystems/1/config {\"code\":\"1234\"}\ndeconz put: error: request 1: http status 404 Not Found\n```\nWhen specifying an invalid value:\n```\n$ deconz put -v /alarmsystems/1/config '{\"armed_away_exit_delay\": \"aap\"}'\ndeconz put: request 1: PUT /alarmsystems/1/config {\"armed_away_exit_delay\":\"aap\"}\ndeconz put: error: request 1: http status 503 Service Unavailable\n```\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n#### Ad 1 - wrong API error reporting:\nWhen specifying an invalid attribute, the API should return HTTP status 200 OK with error(s) in the response body, like e.g.:\n```\n$ deconz put -v /sensors/1/config '{\"code\": \"1234\"}'\ndeconz put: request 1: PUT /sensors/1/config {\"code\":\"1234\"}\ndeconz put: warning: request 1: /sensors/1/config/code: api error 6: parameter, code, not available\n[\n  {\n    \"error\": {\n      \"address\": \"/sensors/1/config/code\",\n      \"description\": \"parameter, code, not available\",\n      \"type\": 6\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\nWhen specifying an invalid value, the API should return HTTP status 200 OK with errors in the response body, like e.g.:\n```\n$ deconz put -v /alarmsystems/1/config '{\"code0\": \"aap\"}'\ndeconz put: request 1: PUT /alarmsystems/1/config {\"code0\":\"aap\"}\ndeconz put: warning: request 1: /alarmsystems/1/config/code0: api error 7: invalid value, aap, for parameter, code0\n[\n  {\n    \"error\": {\n      \"address\": \"/alarmsystems/1/config/code0\",\n      \"description\": \"invalid value, aap, for parameter, code0\",\n      \"type\": 7\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\n#### Ad 4 IAS ACE devices\nThe _IAS Zone_ should be exposed as a separate `ZHAAlarm` resource.  The associated items, `state/tampered`, `state/lowbattery` , `config/enrolled`, and `config/pending` should be removed from the `ZHAAnciallaryControl`.  The DDF validator needs to be changed, as it currently treats these attributes as mandatory for `ZHAAnciallaryControl`.\n\n#### Ad 5 Panel Status Change\nThe alarm system should send _Panel Status Change_ notification to each linked _IAS ACE_ device when its `state/armstate` changes.  There's no need for this, when only `state/seconds_remaining` changes, as the _IAS ACE_ device counts down by itself.\n\n#### Ad 6 Panel state\n`state/panel` should be exposed as `config/armstate` and `state/seconds_remaining` as `config/seconds_remaining`.\n\n#### Ad 7. Limited use of IAS ACE devices\nThe panel attributes, `config/armstate` and `config/seconds_remaining` sould be updatable over the API, resulting in a _Panel State Change_ command, so the _IAS ACE_ device can also be used independently from an alarm system.\nThe entered code might be exposed as `state/code`.\n\n### Screenshots\n\nn/a\n\n### Environment\n\n- Host system: all\n- Running method: all\n- Firmware version: all\n- deCONZ version (not Home assistant Addon version!): 2.29.2 (and others)\n- Device: all\n- Do you use an USB extension cable: n/a\n- Is there any other USB or serial devices connected to the host system?

As usual, the Hue-specific _Configuration_ attribute (0x0031) on the _Basic_ cluster needs to be set to 0x000B for this.  Both unicast and group bindings from the (client) _On/Off_ cluster seem to work.\r\n\r\nThere is one caveat, however: the _On/Off_ commands are sent for both inputs, when configured as _Dual Rocker Switch_ or _Dual Push Button_.\r\n\r\nAlso note that, despite the presence of a (client) _Level Control_ cluster, the module won't sent _Level Control_ commands, even after binding the _Level Control_ cluster configuring the module as _Push Button_.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the behavior\r\n\r\nWrite 0x000B to _Configuration_ in the _Basic_ cluster, and create a binding from the (client) _On/Off_ cluster to a light or group.  Observe that the light state changes and the FC00 button event is received.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nAPI should expose `config/groups` on the ZHASwitch `sensors` resource.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- Host system: All\r\n- Running method: All\r\n- Firmware version: All\r\n- deCONZ version (not Home assistant Addon version!): v2.28.1 and earlier\r\n- Device: All\r\n- Do you use an USB extension cable: (yes / no) -- only relevant for ConBee I/II/III\r\n- Is there any other USB or serial devices connected to the host system? If so: Which?\r\n\r\n\r\n### deCONZ Logs\r\n\r\n```\r\nSep 28 12:16:33 pi5 deCONZ[1825028]: 12:16:33:205 [INFO] - No button map for: RDM004, broadcast to: 0x006E, endpoint: 0x01, cluster: ONOFF (0x0006), command: OFF_WITH_EFFECT (0x40), payload: 0000, zclSeq: 34\r\nSep 28 12:16:33 pi5 deCONZ[1825028]: 12:16:33:248 [INFO] - No button map for: RDM004, unicast to: 0x0000, endpoint: 0x01, cluster: 0xFC00, command: 0x00, payload: 0100003000210000, zclSeq: 33\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",

This would also have the advantage that they get listed under https://dresden-elektronik.github.io/deconz-rest-doc/devices\r\n\r\nI hope to get the already existing C++ PRs merged in the upcoming betas with real device testing where possible and ideally together with a DDF. The current Device/DDF implementation still has glitches and performance, which is another thing I'd like to focus on over the next releases.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat being said: device requests can be done, but will only be taken care of if a DDF can be made for it. \r\n\r\nKind regards, \r\nDennis \r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "body": "I'd like to provide a frank overview about present support challenges in order to provide a better understanding and a small glimpse into the future.\r\n\r\nWhen problems and bugs are reported it's just natural to want them to get solved. If that doesn't happen in a timely manner the frustration level rises, we understand that. Albeit bugs get fixed regularly it's not possible to fix everything and solve every problem a user might face in a short amount of time.\r\n\r\nIt's a ongoing challenge at scale as the user number grow rapidly, currently we're at >95K gateways with 5K added each month, given these numbers the amount of support cases is relative small but it's still hard to manage to get everybody happy.\r\n\r\nThere is the Phoscon support email address, which was working nicely in the beginning but currently we struggle to answer all mails, there is only that much you can answer in one day. We have one very hard working full time support guy and also internal developers jumped in to help, but it has grown that much that it's not possible anymore to answer everything.\r\n\r\nBut, I've just got the info from HR that we finally get a further support member to extend the team very soon, it was hard to find someone, the job offer was out for months.\r\n\r\nRegardless, it's apparent that the email approach doesn't work anymore, therefore we're looking into other directions to address this better, one of them is a separate forum for end users, so this Github issue tracker will become sole about the REST-API and new device requests.\r\n\r\nNot so long ago this Github issue tracker was not moderated, and as a result it got messy over time. Luckily Dennis stood up and offered to moderate and bring order into this. It's a hard cut from the old way and I understand it can be seen as too progressive at times. Please understand us here, without going strict and enforcing, for example templates and separate issues for separate problems, we don't stand a chance. Dennis and other moderators and developers provide all this help in their spare time for which I'm deeply grateful. In case of fixing bugs and adding new devices the streamlined approach has helped dramatically.  Thanks to the templates many question which always were needed to be asked are answered beforehand.\r\n\r\nBeing a moderator or support worker is tough, you got blamed for all sorts of stuff, get all the sh:t, all the frustration and rarely they get thanked for or at least get respected for all the help and work provided. And they need to make tough decisions, closing issues, requesting new issues to be made and asking frustrating questions is part of it. Not everybody knows everything, the Zigbee world is damn complex and we're all learning; it can also occur that things are asked for because of misunderstandings or wrong assumptions, nothing can be perfect, but we're making progress.\r\n\r\nWhat I would like everybody to understand is, we are all just people, no matter if user, moderator, developer or support and as such we all need to keep the discussions calm and polite at a professional level — there shall be no place for disrespect or rudeness from any side, I know this is difficult, but this is the only way to make progress and to figure issues out. In that regard a page will be introduced which describes how and why things get handled they way they are, a set of community rules, and also the reasoning behind some tricky matters, there is no silver bullet but it's a step.\r\n\r\n#### It's all about progress\r\n\r\nThere are some really nasty issues, like the IKEA routing quest in larger networks which goes on for years now, lots of fancy stuff has been tried here, and it's tricky because it can't be reproduced easily. But the work here continues as we try out further things.  In the company we have build a new test network with all sorts of devices in order to better reproduce bugs in real world and large networks.\r\n\r\nAnother tricky one is the USB issue within Docker containers. It may not look like it from the outside but such things have a high priority and lots of testing and development work *is* going into figuring these out. These \"die hard\" bugs often take months sometimes years to get right, there are no short cuts for complex problems. The USB/Docker issues for example were only figured out last week after many months and versions with improvements and tests.\r\n\r\nBehind the scenes the work on the next major version of deCONZ 3.x has been started a while ago which will come in 2021, this will be a game changer version which solves heaps of issues, I'm looking very forward to it since it also means less support issues.\r\n\r\nThe documentations for C++ side and the REST-API have seen an overhaul and getting updated to let external clients better facilitate the APIs.\r\n\r\nRecently we have introduced release schedules which bring regular beta and stable updates each month, where the stable releases are all about bug fixes, and beta versions include mostly newly supported devices.\r\n\r\nIn terms of supported devices the situation is very diffuse, there are various manually maintained places which list some devices which work with deCONZ, they are all incomplete. And even for the listed devices it's not clear how well they are supported, do they work with client x/y, how do they look in the REST-API and importantly how reliable are they and do they have known issues?\r\n\r\nTo address that future versions will use so called device description files, which include all this data. The documentation as well as supported devices list can be generated automatically. They also guide what products are recommended and something like a rating to not run into known issues when extending the home arsenal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm aware this won't please everyone, but I hope it sheds a bit of light at the current state.\r\n\r\n– Manu\n\nDevice\nScreenshots ",
