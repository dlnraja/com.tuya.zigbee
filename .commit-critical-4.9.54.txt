fix(CRITICAL): USB 2-port Port 2 was STILL commented - v4.9.54

CRITICAL REGRESSION FIX:
❌ usb_outlet_2port Port 2 was STILL commented out
❌ Our massive fix script missed /* REFACTOR */ block comments
❌ Only caught // line comments

ROOT CAUSE:
The file had BOTH block comments AND line comments:
```
/* REFACTOR: ... */
// this.registerCapability('onoff.usb2', 6, {
```

Our script only looked for `// this.registerCapability` and missed
the block comment pattern.

FIX APPLIED:
✅ Uncommented Port 2 registerCapability completely
✅ Added verbose logging for Port 2
✅ Fixed CLUSTER.ON_OFF usage
✅ Complete configuration with get/set/report

DRIVERS FIXED IN v4.9.54:
- usb_outlet_2port: Port 2 NOW properly configured

This explains why user still had issues after re-pairing!
Port 2 was never registered, so it stayed invisible.

User needs to:
1. Update to v4.9.54
2. Remove USB 2-port device
3. Factory reset
4. Re-pair ONE MORE TIME
5. Should now see BOTH ports!
