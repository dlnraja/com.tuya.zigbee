Hi @Cam!

You're absolutely right about the UX - those technical names are confusing! I really appreciate the feedback.

**For your HOBEIAN motion sensor with lux:**

The driver you need is: **"Motion Temp Humidity Illumination Multi Battery"**

I know, terrible name! üòÖ Here's the quick way to find it:
- Search for: **"Multi"** or **"Illumination"**
- It's the one that shows: Motion + Lux + Battery + Temp + Humidity

**Why it didn't work before:**
Your exact variant (ZG-204**L**) was missing from the supported devices. I added it in v2.15.54.

**Steps to pair:**
1. Update app to v2.15.54
2. Remove old device if already paired
3. Add device ‚Üí Search "Multi"
4. Follow pairing instructions

**What you'll get:**
‚úÖ Motion detection
‚úÖ Light level (lux) - your key feature!
‚úÖ Battery percentage
‚úÖ Temperature (might work depending on exact model)
‚úÖ Humidity (might work depending on exact model)

**UX improvements coming:**
I'm working on renaming all drivers to be more user-friendly:
- BEFORE: "Motion Temp Humidity Illumination Multi Battery"
- AFTER: "Multi-Sensor (Motion + Lux + Temp)"

Plus better icons and device examples. This feedback is exactly what I needed!

Let me know if it works!

Hi @Peter_van_Werkhoven!

I found the issue - you tested v2.15.49, but the fix for your diagnostic report (1c9d6ce6) was released in **v2.15.52** (on Oct 13).

**Timeline:**
- v2.15.49 (Oct 12) - ‚ùå No fix yet
- v2.15.52 (Oct 13 00:10) - ‚úÖ **IAS Zone fix for your issue**
- v2.15.54 (Oct 13 00:25) - ‚úÖ Latest version

**The fix:**
I corrected the IAS Zone enrollment method - the old code used an API that doesn't exist. The new code uses the proper Zigbee attribute write.

**Please try again:**
1. **Update to v2.15.54**
2. **Remove your devices** (critical - they need to re-enroll)
3. **Re-pair them**
4. **Test motion/button**

**Expected behavior:**
- Motion sensor: Walk in front ‚Üí triggers within 1-2 sec
- SOS button: Press ‚Üí triggers immediately, auto-resets after 5 sec

**If still not working:**
Please generate a **new diagnostic report** after installing v2.15.54 and re-pairing. This will show me if the enrollment succeeded.

Thanks for your patience!

Dylan
