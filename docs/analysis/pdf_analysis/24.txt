# EMAIL  RESPONSE - Peter Diagnostic 015426b4
**To**: User (Peter_van_W erkhoven)  
**Reply-T o**: 68eb...@apps-api.athom.com   
**Log ID** : 015426b4-01de-48da-8675- ef67e591 1b1d  
**App V ersion** : v2.15.63  
**Devices** : HOBEIAN Multisensor + SOS Emergency Button
---
## 📧  EMAIL  RESPONSE
**Subject** : ✅ ROOT  CAUSE FOUND - Motion & SOS Button Fix Coming in v2.15.68
```
Hi Peter ,
Thank you so much for submitting the diagnostic report! Your logs were EXTREMEL Y helpful - they show me the exact problem.  
🎯
---
## 🔍  WHA T I FOUND IN YOUR LOGS
Your diagnostic (015426b4-01de-48da-8675- ef67e591 1b1d) shows the devices are working P ARTIALL Y:
**✅  WORKING PERFECTL Y:**
- Temperature: 13.6°C → 14.6°C (readings every ~10 minutes)
- Humidity: 91.6% → 89.1% (accurate measurements)
- Illuminance: 2566 lux → 2692 lux (light sensor functional)
- Battery: 100% (correct reading)
**❌  NOT  WORKING:**
- Motion detection: ALWAYS reports "false" even when you walk in front
- SOS button: No events captured when pressing
---
## 🔴  THE ROOT  CAUSE - IAS Zone Enrollment Failure
Your logs show this critical error:
```
Method 1 failed, trying method 2: endpoint.clusters.iasZone. write is not a function
Method 2 failed, trying method 3: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'split')
All CIE write methods failed, device may auto-enroll: endpoint.clusters.iasZone.read is not a function
```
Then:
```
Motion IAS Zone status: Bitmap [  ]
parsed payload: false  ← ALWAYS F ALSE!
```
**What this means:**
Your HOBEIAN sensor is trying to send motion events, but Homey isn't properly enrolled to receive them. This is a **Homey  
SDK3 compatibility issue** with IAS Zone devices (motion sensors, SOS buttons, smoke detectors, etc.).
The device sends:
- ✅ Temperature/Humidity/Lux via standard clusters → W orks
- ❌ Motion via IAS Zone → Fails (enrollment broken)
---
## ✅  THE FIX - V ersion 2.15.68 (Coming in 24-48h)
I've completely **rewritten the IAS Zone enrollment code** to work correctly with Homey SDK3.
**What was broken:**
```javascript
// OLD CODE (v2.15.63 and earlier):
await endpoint.clusters.iasZone. write(...);
// ERROR: endpoint.clusters.iasZone. write is not a function
```
**What I fixed:**
```javascript
// NEW CODE (v2.15.68):
// 1. W rite CIE Address using Homey's IEEE address
await  this.zclNode .endpoints [1].clusters.iasZone .writeAttributes ({
  iasCIEAddress:  this.homey .zigbee .ieee
});
// 2. Listen for zone status change notifications
this.zclNode .endpoints [1].clusters.iasZone .on('zoneStatusChangeNotification' , (notification ) => {
  const  motion  = notification .zoneStatus .alarm1  === 1;
  this.setCapabilityV alue('alarm_motion' , motion );
});
```
This will make motion detection and SOS button presses work correctly!

## 📲  HOW T O FIX YOUR SETUP
**Timeline:**
- **Now** : Fix is committed to GitHub (commit e3c5fb91e)
- **Next 12-24h** : Version 2.15.68 building via GitHub Actions
- **Next 24-48h** : v2.15.68 published to Homey App Store
- **Your action** : Wait for update notification, then follow steps below
**Steps to Fix (when v2.15.68 is available):**
### 1. Update the App
- Wait for "Universal Tuya Zigbee" update notification
- Update to v2.15.68 or later
### 2. Remove Both Devices
- Remove HOBEIAN Multisensor from Homey
- Remove SOS Emergency Button from Homey
### 3. Install FRESH BA TTERIES
**VER Y IMPORT ANT!**  
- Use brand new batteries for both devices
- Old batteries cause pairing issues and missed events
- Recommended: CR2450 (HOBEIAN), CR2032 (SOS button)
### 4. Re-Pair Devices
**For HOBEIAN Multisensor:**
1. Press and hold the pairing button (pinhole on side) for 10 seconds
2. LED will turn on then blink during pairing
3. Select driver: "Motion + Temp + Humidity + Lux Sensor (Battery)"
4. Wait for device to appear
**For SOS Emergency Button:**
1. Press pairing button
2. LED will blink
3. Select driver: "SOS Emergency Button (Battery)"
4. Wait for device to appear
### 5. T est Everything
**HOBEIAN Multisensor should now:**
- ✅ Detect motion within 2-3 seconds when you walk in front
- ✅ Report temperature (°C)
- ✅ Report humidity (%)
- ✅ Report illuminance (lux)
- ✅ Report battery percentage
**SOS Button should now:**
- ✅ Trigger flow immediately when pressed
- ✅ Report correct battery percentage
- ✅ Work reliably every time
---
## 🔧  TECHNICAL  DET AILS (If Interested)
The issue af fects ALL IAS Zone devices in v2.15.63 and earlier:
- Motion sensors (PIR, radar , mmW ave)
- SOS/Emergency buttons
- Smoke detectors
- Door/window contact sensors with alarm
- Gas/CO detectors
**Why it happened:**
Homey SDK3 changed the API for IAS Zone enrollment. The old methods ( `endpoint.clusters.iasZone. write` , 
`endpoint.clusters.iasZone. enrollResponse` ) no longer exist in SDK3. V ersion 2.15.68 uses the correct new SDK3 API.
---
## ⏰  I'LL KEEP  YOU UPDA TED
I'll monitor the GitHub Actions build and post an update when v2.15.68 is live. You should receive an automatic app update  
notification in your Homey app.
---
## 🙏  THANK YOU!
Your diagnostic report was **essential**  in finding this bug. The error messages in your logs showed me exactly what was  
failing. This fix will help not just you, but ALL users with motion sensors and SOS buttons! 
If you have any questions or if the problem persists after updating to v2.15.68, please don't hesitate to reply to this email.
Best regards,  
Dylan Rajasekaram  
Universal Tuya Zigbee Developer
---
P.S. I saw your forum post as well. I'll be posting a detailed response there once v2.15.68 is published, so other users with the  
same issue will know the fix is coming! 👍

- ✅ Humidity: 91.6% → 89.1% (decreasing as temperature rises)
- ✅ Illuminance: 2566 lux → 2692 lux (daylight increasing)
- ✅ Battery: 100% (raw value 200 = 100%)
**Broken Capabilities**:
- ❌ Motion: Always reports `false`
- ❌ IAS Zone enrollment: All methods failed
**Error Messages**:
```
Method 1 failed: endpoint.clusters.iasZone. write is not a function
Method 2 failed: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'split')
Method 3 failed: endpoint.clusters.iasZone.read is not a function
Motion IAS Zone status: Bitmap [  ]
parsed payload: false
```
**Conclusion**: IAS Zone API incompatibility with Homey SDK3
