## 💬 Need More Help?

If your devices still appear as "generic" after updating to v1.8.1:

1. **Remove the devices** from Homey
2. **Wait 30 seconds**
3. **Re-add them** via "Add Device"
4. They should now be properly recognized!

If issues persist, please post the handshake data and I'll add more manufacturer IDs.
