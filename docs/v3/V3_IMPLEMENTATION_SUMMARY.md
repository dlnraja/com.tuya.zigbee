## üö® IDENTIFIED ISSUES

### Critical: Driver Overlaps

**Detected:**
- 13,280 critical overlaps
- 103 manufacturer ID conflicts
- 68 product ID conflicts

**Examples:**
```
‚ùå Temperature Sensor ‚Üî Smoke Detector
   Product overlap: TS0205, TS0207, TS0222, TS0225
   ‚Üí User confusion, wrong driver detection

‚ùå Temperature Sensor has 109 product IDs
   ‚Üí Many don't belong to temperature sensors
   ‚Üí Includes switch, plug, curtain IDs
```

**Impact:**
- Wrong driver detection during pairing
- User frustration (diagnostic report #906cebef)
- Capability mismatches
- Flow creation issues

**Action Required:**
1. Clean up `temperature_sensor_battery` product IDs
2. Separate smoke+temp combo drivers
3. Verify all driver product ID lists
4. Re-run overlap detection
5. Update documentation
