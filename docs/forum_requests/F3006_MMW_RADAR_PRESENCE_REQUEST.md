## üìä COMPARISON: PIR vs mmWave

### Traditional PIR Sensor

```
Technology: Passive Infrared
Detection: Heat signatures
Obstacles: Blocked by walls/furniture
False negatives: Stationary people undetected
Distance: Basic (no measurement)
```

### mmWave Radar (This Device)

```
Technology: 5.8GHz Microwave
Detection: Micro-movements + breathing
Obstacles: Sees through obstacles
False negatives: Rare (detects micro-motion)
Distance: Precise (0-10m measurement)
Illuminance: Integrated sensor
```

---

## üéØ USE CASES

### 1. Bedroom Presence

```
Scenario: Detect presence even when sleeping
mmWave: ‚úÖ Detects breathing
PIR: ‚ùå Fails when stationary
Distance: Monitor if person in bed
Illuminance: Auto-lights based on darkness
```

### 2. Office Occupancy

```
Scenario: Keep lights on while working at desk
mmWave: ‚úÖ Detects micro-movements (typing)
PIR: ‚ùå Turns off lights frequently
Distance: Know if someone at desk
Delay: Configurable timeout
```

### 3. Bathroom Automation

```
Scenario: Smart ventilation control
mmWave: ‚úÖ Detects shower use
PIR: ‚ùå May miss through curtain
Range: Minimum/maximum zones
Presence time: Track duration
```

---

## üìê INSTALLATION RECOMMENDATIONS

### Mounting

```
Location: Ceiling center
Height: 2.5-3m optimal
Angle: Pointing down
Coverage: 360¬∞ pattern
```

### Range Configuration

**Small Room (< 10m¬≤)**:
```
Minimum range: 0m
Maximum range: 3m
Sensitivity: 5-7
Delay: 30-60s
```

**Medium Room (10-20m¬≤)**:
```
Minimum range: 0m
Maximum range: 5m
Sensitivity: 6-8
Delay: 60-120s
```

**Large Room (> 20m¬≤)**:
```
Minimum range: 0.5m (avoid ceiling)
Maximum range: 8-10m
Sensitivity: 7-9
Delay: 120-300s
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è SETTINGS EXPLAINED

### Sensitivity (0-10)

```
Low (0-3): Only major movements
Medium (4-7): Normal movements (recommended)
High (8-10): Micro-movements (may be too sensitive)

Adjust if:
- Too many false positives ‚Üí Decrease
- Missing detections ‚Üí Increase
```

### Presence Delay (5-3600s)

```
Short (5-30s): Quick response, frequent updates
Medium (30-120s): Balanced (recommended)
Long (120-3600s): Avoid false "away" states

Use cases:
- Bathroom: 60s
- Bedroom: 300s
- Office: 120s
```

### Minimum Range (0-10m)

```
Purpose: Ignore detection closer than this
Use case: Avoid ceiling detection
Recommended: 0m (unless issues)
Ceiling mount: 0.5m to ignore directly overhead
```

### Maximum Range (0.5-10m)

```
Purpose: Limit detection range
Use case: Room boundaries
Recommended: Room size + 1m
Adjacent room: Reduce to room size only
```

### Presence Time (1-3600s)

```
Purpose: Filter short detections
Use case: Avoid walking-through triggers
Recommended: 10-30s
High traffic: 5s
Private room: 30-60s
```

## üîÑ FLOW EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Smart Lighting

```yaml
WHEN: Presence detected (alarm_motion = true)
AND: Illuminance < 50 lux
THEN: Turn on lights

WHEN: Presence cleared (alarm_motion = false)
THEN: Turn off lights after 30s
```

### Example 2: HVAC Control

```yaml
WHEN: Presence detected
AND: Room empty for > 10 minutes
THEN: Resume HVAC to comfort mode

WHEN: Presence cleared for > 30 minutes
THEN: Set HVAC to eco mode
```

### Example 3: Distance-Based Automation

```yaml
WHEN: Distance < 2m (measure_numeric)
THEN: Someone near desk
ACTION: Keep task light on

WHEN: Distance > 5m
THEN: Someone in room but far
ACTION: Only ambient light
```

### Example 4: Security

```yaml
WHEN: Presence detected
AND: Security system armed
AND: Time between 22:00-06:00
THEN: Send alert + Turn on all lights
```

---

## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Too Sensitive

```
Symptoms: Constant presence detection
Solution:
1. Reduce sensitivity (5-6)
2. Reduce maximum range
3. Increase minimum range (0.5m)
4. Check for fans/moving objects
```

### Issue: Missing Detections

```
Symptoms: Doesn't detect presence
Solution:
1. Increase sensitivity (8-9)
2. Increase maximum range
3. Reduce minimum range (0m)
4. Check mounting angle
5. Verify power supply
```

### Issue: False "Away" States

```
Symptoms: Loses presence when stationary
Solution:
1. Increase presence delay (120-300s)
2. Increase sensitivity
3. mmWave should detect breathing
4. Check firmware version
```

### Issue: No Distance Reading

```
Symptoms: Distance always 0 or no updates
Solution:
1. Normal if no presence detected
2. Distance only reported during presence
3. Check device logs
4. Verify DP 19 support
```

## üìû FORUM RESPONSE TEMPLATE

```markdown
Hi @F3006,

Great news! I've added full support for your mmWave Radar Presence Sensor (_TZE204_qasjif9e).

**Driver Created**: mmWave Radar Presence Sensor

**Features**:
‚úÖ Presence detection (motion alarm)
‚úÖ Distance measurement (0-10m)
‚úÖ Illuminance sensor (0-10,000 lux)
‚úÖ Configurable sensitivity
‚úÖ Range settings (min/max)
‚úÖ Presence delay control

**To use it**:
1. Update to latest app version (v4.7.2+)
2. Remove device if already paired
3. Add device ‚Üí Select "mmWave Radar Presence Sensor"
4. Pair device (usually auto-detected)
5. Configure settings to your room

**Recommended Settings**:
- Sensitivity: 7
- Presence delay: 60s
- Min range: 0m
- Max range: Match your room size

This is a much more advanced sensor than standard PIR - it detects micro-movements and even breathing, so it works great for bedrooms and offices where people are stationary.

Let me know how it works!

Cheers,
dlnraja
```
