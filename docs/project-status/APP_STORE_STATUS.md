## ü§î Why Not Just Update Original App?

**Questions from the community addressed:**

### "Why not submit updates to Johan's app?"

- Johan Bendz's repository shows no activity for 1+ years
- Community policy allows continuation of inactive apps
- Different App ID prevents conflicts
- Allows faster iteration and community-driven development

### "Will this replace Johan's app?"

No, this coexists with the original:
- Different App ID: `com.dlnraja.tuya.zigbee`
- Users can choose which to use
- Original app remains available if Johan returns
- Full credit and attribution maintained

### "What if Johan returns to development?"

We would:
- Welcome his return enthusiastically
- Offer to merge improvements back
- Collaborate on future development
- Continue to credit him as original author
