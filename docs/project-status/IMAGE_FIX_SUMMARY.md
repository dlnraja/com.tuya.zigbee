# Image Fix Summary - Homey SDK3 Compliance

## Problem Identified
Homey App Store certification was blocked due to incorrect image dimensions.

## Root Cause
The application had two separate image requirements that were conflated:

### APP Images (assets/images/)
Used for the app itself in Homey App Store
- `small.png`: 250 x 175 px
- `large.png`: 500 x 350 px  
- `xlarge.png`: 1000 x 700 px

### DRIVER Images (assets/)
Used by individual device drivers
- `small.png`: 75 x 75 px
- `large.png`: 500 x 500 px
- `xlarge.png`: 1000 x 1000 px

## Solution Applied
1. ✅ Created professional APP images in `assets/images/` with correct dimensions (250x175, 500x350, 1000x700)
2. ✅ Created professional DRIVER images in `assets/` with correct dimensions (75x75, 500x500, 1000x1000)
3. ✅ Modern gradient design with Zigbee network pattern and brand color (#1E88E5)
4. ✅ Removed duplicate files that were in wrong locations
5. ✅ Validation passed: `homey app validate --level publish` ✓

## Design Features
- **Professional gradient**: Blue theme (#1E88E5 → #1976D2 → #1565C0)
- **Zigbee network pattern**: Hexagonal mesh representing Zigbee protocol
- **Central "Z" icon**: White hexagon with blue "Z" symbol
- **Modern styling**: Shadow effects and professional typography
- **Brand consistency**: Matches app.json brandColor

## Validation Result
```
✓ Pre-processing app...
✓ Validating app...
✓ App validated successfully against level `publish`
```

## Files Modified
- `assets/images/small.png` - 250x175 px (APP)
- `assets/images/large.png` - 500x350 px (APP)
- `assets/images/xlarge.png` - 1000x700 px (APP)

- `assets/large.png` - 500x500 px (DRIVER)
- `assets/xlarge.png` - 1000x1000 px (DRIVER)

## Scripts Used
