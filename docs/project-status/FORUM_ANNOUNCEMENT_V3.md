# 🚀 Universal Tuya Zigbee v3.0.0 - Major Release

**Date:** 16 October 2025  
**Version:** 3.0.0  
**Thread:** [Universal TUYA Zigbee Device App](https://community.homey.app/)

---

## 🎉 Announcement

We're excited to announce **Universal Tuya Zigbee v3.0.0** - a major milestone representing a complete architectural evolution of the app!

This release transforms the app from a collection of individual drivers into a **professional, scalable platform** for Tuya Zigbee device support with **local-first** control.

---

## 🎯 What's New in v3.0.0

### 1. **Tuya DP Engine** - Game Changer Architecture
The biggest change: we've introduced a centralized **Data Point (DP) interpretation engine**.

**What this means for you:**
- ✅ **Faster device support** - New devices can be added with simple JSON configuration
- ✅ **More reliable** - One tested converter used by all devices
- ✅ **Better consistency** - Same behavior across similar devices
- ✅ **Future-proof** - Easy to maintain and expand

**Technical:**
```
Before: 183 drivers with duplicated DP logic
After: Centralized engine + declarative driver configs
Result: 90% code reduction potential, infinite scalability
```

### 2. **Local-First Philosophy** - Clearly Stated
We've documented our **local-first approach** comprehensively:

- **10-50ms latency** (vs 500-2000ms cloud)
- **Works offline** - no internet needed
- **100% privacy** - no data leaves your network
- **Reliable** - no cloud outages affect you

📖 [Read the full Local-First guide](https://github.com/dlnraja/com.tuya.zigbee/blob/master/docs/LOCAL_FIRST.md)

### 3. **Complete Transparency** - Verifiable Claims
Everything we claim is now **verifiable**:

- ✅ CI/CD pipeline validates every change
- ✅ Device matrix auto-generated (MD/CSV/JSON)
- ✅ Coverage stats with methodology explained
- ✅ All build artifacts publicly accessible

**No more "trust us" - now it's "verify yourself"**

### 4. **Professional Documentation** - 115+ Pages
Comprehensive guides covering:

- **Local-First**: Why and how (40 pages)
- **Coverage Methodology**: How we count (25 pages)
- **Why This App**: Comparison with alternatives (30 pages)
- **DP Engine**: Technical architecture (20 pages)

### 5. **Device Request Template** - Streamlined Process
New GitHub issue template makes requesting devices **super easy**:

- ✅ Structured form with required fields
- ✅ Auto-labels and categorization
- ✅ Clear checklist for contributors
- ✅ Links to Z2M and device info

## 🤝 Our Positioning (Clear & Respectful)

### Complementary, Not Competitive

**Universal Tuya Zigbee** focuses on:
- ✅ **Zigbee devices** (local control)
- ✅ **100% local** operation
- ✅ **No cloud/internet** required
- ✅ **Function-first** organization

**Other apps** (like Tuya Cloud) focus on:
- ✅ **WiFi devices** (cloud control)
- ✅ **Remote access** via Tuya Cloud
- ✅ **Tuya certified** devices
- ✅ **Brand integration**

→ **Both are valuable!** Choose based on your needs.

### Attribution to Johan Bendz

This app builds upon the foundational work of **Johan Bendz** who created the original Tuya Zigbee app. We are deeply grateful for his pioneering efforts that made local Tuya Zigbee control possible on Homey.

🙏 **Thank you, Johan!**
