Hi,

Thank you for your diagnostic report (Log ID: 2c72fd5f-7350-447c-9ab1-24dd4dd39f8d).

I've reviewed your logs but I need more information to help you effectively.

**Current Situation:**
Your app is running correctly (v4.0.5) with all drivers initialized successfully. However, the diagnostic logs only show the app startup (2 seconds) and don't include any device activity.

**To help you, I need:**

1. **Device Information:**
   - What type of devices are affected? (motion sensor, temperature sensor, switch, etc.)
   - Device names or IDs in Homey
   
2. **More Detailed Logs:**
   - Please generate a new diagnostic with a longer timeframe (30 minutes minimum)
   - During this time, try to interact with the devices if possible
   
3. **Device Status:**
   - Are the devices showing as "online" or "offline" in Homey?
   - What's the "Last seen" timestamp for each device?
   - If battery-powered, what's the battery level?

**Quick Troubleshooting Steps:**

1. **Check Device Status:**
   - Go to Homey app â†’ Devices
   - Check if devices show as online/offline
   - Note the "Last seen" time

2. **Try Device Refresh:**
   - Open each device in Homey app
   - Try to force a refresh if available

3. **Battery Check:**
   - If battery-powered, replace batteries
   - Low battery can cause "no data" issues

4. **Zigbee Network:**
   - Check if other Zigbee devices work
   - Try moving devices closer to Homey

5. **Re-pairing (last resort):**
   - Remove devices from Homey
   - Factory reset devices (usually hold button 5 seconds until LED flashes)
   - Re-pair to Homey

**Common Causes & Solutions:**

- **Battery Dead:** Replace batteries
- **Device Too Far:** Move closer to Homey or add Zigbee router
- **Binding Lost:** Re-pair device
- **Zigbee Interference:** Check for WiFi conflicts (use different channels)

**Once you provide:**
- Device types
- Longer diagnostic logs
- Device online/offline status

I'll be able to give you a precise solution.
