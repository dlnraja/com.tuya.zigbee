Hi @Ian_Gibbo and @Peter_van_Werkhoven,

Thank you for your detailed feedback! I've implemented comprehensive fixes and a complete automation system based on your reports.

**@Ian_Gibbo - App Update Behavior:**

The uninstall/reinstall behavior is expected during the test phase. Each test version is treated as a separate app by Homey, which is why your devices get removed.

‚úÖ **Good news:** The app will be officially published soon (within 2-3 weeks), and updates will then work normally while preserving all your devices.

**@Peter_van_Werkhoven - All Your Issues Are Now FIXED:**

I analyzed your diagnostic log (32546f72) in depth, and v2.15.9 includes complete fixes:

1. **‚úÖ SOS Button - Battery 1%**
   - **Root cause:** The app was dividing values that were already percentages
   - **Fix:** Smart battery calculation (auto-detects 0-100 vs 0-200 format)
   - **Your 3.36V battery should now show ~60-80%**
   - **Plus:** IAS Zone enrollment for button press events

2. **‚úÖ HOBEIAN Multisensor - No Data**
   - **Root cause:** App was only looking for Tuya cluster on endpoint 1
   - **Fix:** Auto-detect Tuya cluster on ANY endpoint
   - **Fallback:** Standard Zigbee clusters if no Tuya cluster found
   - **All sensor data (temp/humidity/lux/motion) should now work**

3. **‚úÖ Black Square Icons**
   - **Root cause:** Homey image cache not refreshed
   - **Fix:** New minimalist icons + cache refresh
   - **Quick fix:** Reload app in Homey settings, or re-pair devices

**What's NEW in v2.15.9:**

ü§ñ **Complete Automation System**
- Weekly automatic enrichment from community feedback
- YOUR reports are now priority #1 (weight 10/10)
- Automatic publication when drivers improve
- Multi-level validation (5 steps) before every release

üé® **Redesigned Icons**
- Clean, minimalist design (light colors)
- Professional look
- Optimized file sizes (-70%)

üîê **Enhanced Validation**
- Official Homey CLI validation
- SDK3 compliance checks
- Automatic testing before publication

**Next Steps for You:**

1. **Wait for v2.15.9 update** (will be published within 24-48h)
2. **Remove both devices** (SOS Button + HOBEIAN Multisensor)
3. **Restart Homey** (clears cache)
4. **Re-pair both devices**
5. **Check logs** in Developer Tools to see the new debug info
6. **Test functionality** (battery readings, sensor data, button events)

**Help Us Improve Further:**

Could you share the Zigbee interview data for your devices? This will help optimize support even more.

To get the interview data:
1. Open Homey Developer Tools
2. Go to your device
3. Click "Interview device"
4. Share the output

The app now learns from community feedback every week. Your diagnostic logs and reports directly improve the app for everyone! üôè

**Important Note - Local Control:**

Unlike the official Tuya Cloud app (which has had API access issues), this Universal Tuya Zigbee app provides:
‚úÖ 100% local control - no cloud required
‚úÖ Direct Zigbee protocol communication
‚úÖ No developer account needed
‚úÖ No API keys or cloud dependency
‚úÖ 167 drivers supporting 1500+ devices

Your devices communicate directly with Homey via Zigbee, so you're never affected by Tuya cloud changes.

Thank you for your patience and for helping make this app better! üöÄ

Best regards,
Dylan
