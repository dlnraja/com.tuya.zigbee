Hi @ugrbnk! 👋

Thanks for the diagnostic ID! To help you, I need more details:

**Please tell me:**
1. Which **device** (Multi-sensor? SOS button? Smart plug?)
2. What **problem** exactly (won't pair? not working? no readings?)
3. Which **app version** (check: Homey App → More → Apps → Universal Tuya Zigbee)
4. What **didn't change** after following instructions?

**Quick Check:**
- If you're on **v3.0.23 or older** → Update to v3.0.31+ (many bugs fixed!)
- If device won't pair → Factory reset + put VERY close to Homey (<30cm)
- If paired but not working → Update app, remove device, factory reset, re-pair

Once you provide these details, I can give you specific help! 👍

Diagnostic received: a063a142-b657-42f0-8f0a-622c8674e53f

Regards,
Dylan
