## Response to Peter (Diagnostic: 6c8e96e2-06b1-4c1e-aa45-ed47923a71f2)

Hi Peter,

Thank you for the diagnostic report! I've identified the critical issue:

**Root Cause:**
Version 2.15.125 has a missing module error that prevents the multisensor from initializing:
```
Error: Cannot find module '../../utils/tuya-cluster-handler'
```

This is why you're seeing "last seen 56 years ago" - the device never properly initialized.

**Immediate Fix:**
I'm publishing v2.15.130 right now with:
- âœ… Fixed missing module import
- âœ… Implemented official Homey IAS Zone enrollment method (`onZoneEnrollRequest` + proactive `zoneEnrollResponse`)
- âœ… Corrected syntax error in smoke detector driver

**Important: You MUST re-pair your devices after updating!**

The IAS Zone enrollment happens during pairing. Simply updating the app won't fix already-paired devices.

**Steps to fix:**
1. Wait for v2.15.130 to appear in your Homey App Store (should be available within 5-10 minutes)
2. Update the app
3. **Remove** your multisensor from Homey
4. **Factory reset** the sensor (hold button 5 seconds)
5. **Add it again** to Homey
6. Repeat for SOS button

**Expected logs after re-pairing:**
```
ðŸŽ§ Setting up Zone Enroll Request listener...
ðŸ“¤ Sending proactive Zone Enroll Response...
âœ… Zone Enroll Response sent (zoneId: 10)
```

I apologize for the issues. The fix is based on official Homey SDK documentation and analysis of successful community apps (Philips Hue, Aqara).

Best regards,
Dylan

Hi DutchDuke,

Thanks for the diagnostic report! I found the issue:

**Root Cause:**
Version 2.15.124 has a syntax error in the smoke detector driver that causes it to crash:
```
SyntaxError: Unexpected token '}' at line 284
```

This corrupted driver is causing device misidentification during pairing.

**Fixed in v2.15.130:**
- âœ… Removed syntax error in smoke_detector_battery/device.js
- âœ… Fixed device identification logic
- âœ… Improved driver matching for temperature and soil sensors

**For the temperature sensor discovered as smoke detector:**
1. Update to v2.15.130 (publishing now)
2. Remove the incorrectly-added smoke detector device
3. Factory reset your temperature sensor
4. Add it again - it should now be recognized correctly

**For the soil sensor not being added:**
Can you provide more details?
- Manufacturer ID (visible in Homey developer tools)
- Product ID
- Model number if available

I'll add it to the driver database immediately.

**Alternative:** After updating to v2.15.130, try adding it as a "Generic Zigbee Device" first, then send me a diagnostic report. I can then create a specific driver for it.

Thank you for helping improve the app!

Best regards,
Dylan

## Technical Details (for reference)

### Issues Fixed in v2.15.130:

1. **Missing Module Import**
   - Removed non-existent `tuya-cluster-handler` import
   - Used direct cluster registration instead

2. **Syntax Error**
   - Fixed orphaned `catch` block in smoke_detector_battery/device.js
   - Removed duplicate closing braces

3. **IAS Zone Enrollment**
   - Implemented official Homey method from SDK docs
   - Added `onZoneEnrollRequest` listener
   - Added proactive `zoneEnrollResponse` (critical fallback)
   - Multi-fallback: Standard â†’ Auto â†’ Polling â†’ Passive

4. **Device Identification**
   - Fixed driver matching logic
   - Improved manufacturer/product ID recognition

### Version Timeline:
- v2.15.87-91: IAS Zone enrollment broken
- v2.15.124: Syntax error introduced
- v2.15.125: Missing module error
- v2.15.126-128: Partial fixes
- **v2.15.130: Complete fix** âœ…

### Re-pairing Required:
IAS Zone enrollment occurs during the pairing process. Devices paired with broken versions (2.15.87-128) need to be:
1. Removed from Homey
2. Factory reset
3. Re-added with v2.15.130

This allows the new enrollment method to work correctly.
