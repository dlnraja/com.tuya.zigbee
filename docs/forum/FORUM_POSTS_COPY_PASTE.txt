RESPONSE TO PETER
========================================

Hi Peter,

Thank you for the diagnostic report! I've identified and fixed the critical issue.

**Root Cause:**
Version 2.15.125 had a missing module error that prevented the multisensor from initializing:
```
Error: Cannot find module '../../utils/tuya-cluster-handler'
```

This is why you saw "last seen 56 years ago" - the device never properly initialized.

**Fix Deployed: v2.15.130**
- âœ… Fixed missing module import
- âœ… Implemented official Homey IAS Zone enrollment method
- âœ… Multi-fallback enrollment strategy

**CRITICAL: You MUST re-pair your devices after updating!**

The IAS Zone enrollment happens during the initial pairing process. Simply updating the app won't fix already-paired devices because they were enrolled with broken code.

**Steps:**
1. Wait 5-10 minutes for v2.15.130 to appear in Homey App Store
2. Update the app
3. **Remove** your multisensor from Homey (Settings â†’ Devices â†’ Delete)
4. **Factory reset** the sensor (hold button 5 seconds until LED blinks)
5. **Add it again** to Homey
6. Repeat for SOS button

**Expected logs after re-pairing:**
```
ðŸŽ§ Setting up Zone Enroll Request listener (official method)...
ðŸ“¤ Sending proactive Zone Enroll Response (official fallback)...
âœ… Proactive Zone Enroll Response sent
âœ… Zone Enroll listener configured
```

When motion is detected, you should see:
```
ðŸ“¨ Zone notification received: { zoneStatus: Bitmap [ alarm1 ] }
ðŸš¨ ALARM TRIGGERED
```

I apologize for the issues. The fix is based on official Homey SDK documentation and analysis of successful community apps (Philips Hue Zigbee by Johan Bendz, Aqara/Xiaomi by Maxmudjon).

Please send a new diagnostic report after re-pairing so I can confirm everything works!

Best regards,
Dylan

RESPONSE TO DUTCHDUKE

Hi DutchDuke,

Thanks for the diagnostic report! I found the issue.

**Root Cause:**
Version 2.15.124 had a syntax error in the smoke detector driver:
```
SyntaxError: Unexpected token '}' at line 284
```

This corrupted driver caused device misidentification during pairing.

**Fix Deployed: v2.15.130**
- âœ… Syntax error fixed (was actually fixed in v2.15.126)
- âœ… Improved device identification logic
- âœ… Better driver matching

**For the temperature sensor discovered as smoke detector:**
1. Update to v2.15.130 (will be available in 5-10 minutes)
2. Remove the incorrectly-added smoke detector device
3. Factory reset your temperature sensor
4. Add it again - should now be recognized correctly

**For the soil sensor not being added:**
Can you provide more details? I need:
- Manufacturer name (visible in Homey developer tools)
- Product ID
- Model number from the device

I'll add it to the driver database immediately.

**Alternative:**
After updating to v2.15.130, try pairing it and send me a diagnostic report immediately after. Even if it's not recognized, the logs will show me the manufacturer/product IDs I need to add support.

Thank you for helping improve the app!

Best regards,
Dylan
