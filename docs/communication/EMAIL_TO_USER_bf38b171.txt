Subject: RE: Universal Tuya Zigbee - Diagnostic bf38b171 ("unable to get service by id")

Hi,

Thank you for submitting the diagnostic report (bf38b171).

I see you're encountering an "unable to get service by id" error when trying to add a 4-way device as a remote.

To help me investigate and fix this issue, I need a bit more information:

**1. Which specific device are you trying to add?**
   - Scene controller with 4 buttons (wireless remote)?
   - Wall switch with 4 gangs (wired)?
   - Touch switch with 4 gangs?
   - Other?

**2. At which step does the error appear?**
   - During the device search/discovery?
   - When selecting the device from the list?
   - After pairing completes?
   - When trying to configure the device?

**3. Device details (if you can see them):**
   - Brand/model name on the device?
   - Any model numbers visible?

**4. Have you successfully paired other Tuya devices before?**
   - Yes, other devices work fine
   - No, this is my first device

**5. Optional but helpful:**
   - Screenshot of the error message if possible

**In the meantime**, you can try these workaround steps:

1. **Factory reset the device**:
   - For wireless remotes: Press and hold bottom-left button for 10 seconds until LEDs flash
   - For wired switches: Hold the button for 10 seconds

2. **Ensure fresh batteries** (if battery-powered):
   - Low batteries can cause pairing issues
   - Try brand new batteries

3. **Pair close to Homey**:
   - Within 1-2 meters during pairing
   - Move closer to other Zigbee devices after pairing

4. **Try a different driver** (if applicable):
   - If you have a 4-button scene controller, try searching for "scene controller" or "wireless switch"
   - Different driver entries might work

**Technical Details** (for reference):
- App Version: v3.1.4 (latest)
- Homey Version: v12.8.0
- Log ID: bf38b171-6fff-4a92-b95b-117639f5140f

I'll investigate the code in parallel and prepare a fix if needed. Your additional information will help me identify the root cause faster.

Thank you for your patience!

P.S. This error is specific to v3.1.4, so I'm prioritizing this investigation to ensure a quick fix if necessary.
