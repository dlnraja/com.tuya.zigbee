Subject: üî¥ CRITICAL UPDATE: Universal Tuya Zigbee v3.0.37+ Required - IAS Zone Crash Fix

Hi,

We've identified and fixed a critical crash affecting users with IAS Zone devices (motion sensors, contact sensors, SOS buttons) on app versions v3.0.23 and earlier.

üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUE - FIXED IN v3.0.37

Your diagnostic report shows you're running **v3.0.23**, which contains a critical bug that causes crashes when Homey restarts.

**Crash Error:**
"Zigbee is aan het opstarten. Wacht even en probeer het opnieuw."

**Affected Devices:**
- SOS Emergency Buttons
- Motion Sensors (PIR, mmWave, all variants)
- Contact Sensors (door/window sensors)
- All IAS Zone security devices

**What Was Wrong:**
The app sent a Zigbee command during initialization before the Zigbee subsystem was ready, violating Homey SDK best practices.

**What's Fixed (v3.0.37+):**
- Removed proactive enrollment call
- Now uses listener-only approach (official Homey method)
- Zero crashes on Homey restart
- IAS Zone devices enroll reliably when they request it

---

‚úÖ ACTION REQUIRED: UPDATE NOW

**Update via Homey CLI:**
```bash
homey app install com.dlnraja.tuya.zigbee
```

**Or wait for App Store approval** (usually within 24-48 hours)

**After Update:**
- Your devices will continue working normally
- No re-pairing required
- Crashes eliminated

üìù YOUR SPECIFIC ISSUES

Based on your diagnostic (Log ID: 27752b0b-0616-4f1d-9cb4-59982935ad9b):

**1. SOS Button:**
- ‚úÖ Currently working (battery 96%, enrolled successfully)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è BUT at risk of crashes with v3.0.23
- ‚úÖ Update to v3.0.37+ to eliminate crash risk

**2. Multisensor Pairing Issue:**
Your multisensor shows classic "ghost device" symptoms:
- Device paired in Zigbee network
- But not visible in Homey device list
- "Already added" error during re-pairing

**Fix for Ghost Device:**
1. **Remove from Zigbee network:**
   - Homey Settings ‚Üí Zigbee ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Remove Device
   - Enter IEEE address if known, or use "Remove Failed Node"
2. **Factory reset the multisensor:**
   - Follow manufacturer's reset procedure (usually long-press button)
   - LED should blink rapidly indicating reset success
3. **Re-pair within 2 meters of Homey:**
   - Start pairing in Homey app
   - Activate pairing mode on sensor
   - Wait 60 seconds for full enrollment
4. **Send new diagnostic after successful pairing**
