## üìù REQUIRED INFORMATION

To help the user, we need:

### 1. Device Details
- Exact device type (brand, model)
- Driver used in Homey
- Number of buttons/ports expected vs visible

### 2. Pairing Information
- Was device paired BEFORE or AFTER v4.9.53 update?
- If existing device: did user remove and re-pair?
- Pairing method used

### 3. Specific Problem
- Exact symptom description
- Expected behavior vs actual behavior
- Screenshot of device in Homey app

### 4. New Diagnostic with Device Activity
Current log only shows app start, we need logs that include:
- Device pairing attempt
- Device initialization (onNodeInit)
- registerCapability calls
- Any error messages

---

## üéØ NEXT STEPS

### For User:

1. **Provide More Details**:
   - What device is having problems?
   - What exactly is not working?
   - Screenshots?

2. **If Multi-Gang Device**:
   - Remove device from Homey
   - Factory reset device
   - Re-pair with v4.9.53
   - Submit NEW diagnostic WITH device logs

3. **Enable Verbose Logging**:
   - Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Universal Tuya Zigbee
   - Pair or interact with device
   - Check logs for verbose output
   - Submit diagnostic

### Expected in New Logs:

```
üîå Configuring Port 1 (endpoint 1)...
  - Capability onoff exists
  - Registering with CLUSTER.ON_OFF on endpoint 1
[OK] ‚úÖ Port 1 configured successfully
```

If these logs are missing, it means:
- Device was paired on older version
- User needs to re-pair device
- Or device doesn't match expected driver

## üìß EMAIL RESPONSE TO USER

**Subject**: Re: Universal Tuya Zigbee - Need More Details (v4.9.53)

Hi there,

Thank you for your diagnostic report for v4.9.53!

However, I need more information to help you. The log you sent only shows the app starting up, but doesn't include any device activity or error messages.

**Could you please provide:**

1. **Which device** is having the issue?
   - USB outlet (2-port/3-port)?
   - Wall switch (3-gang/4-gang/6-gang)?
   - Other device type?

2. **What exactly is the problem?**
   - Device not pairing?
   - Not all buttons showing?
   - Buttons not responding?
   - Other issue?

3. **Important: Did you re-pair the device after updating to v4.9.53?**
   - If not, please do this:
     1. Remove device from Homey
     2. Factory reset the device
     3. Re-pair it with v4.9.53
   
   This is **required** because v4.9.53 fixed a major issue where multi-gang devices only showed 1 button. Existing devices paired on older versions need to be re-paired to get the fix.

4. **Send a new diagnostic report** that includes:
   - Logs from pairing the device
   - Or logs while using the device
   - Not just app startup logs

**Expected behavior in v4.9.53:**
- USB 2-port outlet: Shows 2 separate buttons
- USB 3-port outlet: Shows 3 separate buttons
- 3-gang switch: Shows 3 separate buttons
- 4-gang switch: Shows 4 separate buttons
- 6-gang switch: Shows 6 separate buttons

If you still only see 1 button after re-pairing on v4.9.53, please send a new diagnostic with the device logs and I'll investigate immediately.

Looking forward to your response!

Best regards,
Dylan

## üîÑ POSSIBLE SCENARIOS

### Scenario 1: User Didn't Re-Pair Device
**Most Likely**

- User updated to v4.9.53
- But kept existing device paired on v4.9.50/v4.9.51
- Device still shows only 1 button
- **Solution**: Re-pair device

### Scenario 2: v4.9.53 Fix Doesn't Work
**Unlikely but Possible**

- User re-paired device on v4.9.53
- Still only shows 1 button
- **Solution**: Check device logs, may need specific driver fix

### Scenario 3: Different Issue Entirely
**Unknown**

- User has completely different problem
- Not related to multi-gang button issue
- **Solution**: Need more details from user

---

## üìä MONITORING

**Status**: ‚è≥ Waiting for user response with more details

**Next Check**: When user replies with:
- Specific device information
- Actual problem description
- New diagnostic logs with device activity

---

## üéØ CONCLUSION

**Current Status**: Cannot diagnose without more information

**Action Required**: User must provide:
1. Device details
2. Problem description  
3. Re-pair confirmation
4. New diagnostic with device logs

Once received, can perform proper analysis and provide specific fix if needed.
