Hi,

I received your diagnostic report but the log appears truncated. To help you effectively, I need:

1. What specific issue are you experiencing?
   • Which device(s) not working?
   • Error messages?
   • Behavior observed?

2. Device manufacturer IDs:
   • Homey → Settings → Devices → [Device]
   • ⚙️ → Advanced → Zigbee information
   • Copy "manufacturerName" field

3. New diagnostic while testing:
   • Trigger the issue (test device, press button, etc.)
   • THEN submit diagnostic
   • Include detailed message describing the problem

Once I have this info, I can provide targeted help!

Best,
Dylan

## Notes

- Two diagnostics received close together (Oct 15 + Oct 16)
- May be same user or different users
- Both need manufacturer IDs + detailed symptoms
- Create standardized response template for generic diagnostics
