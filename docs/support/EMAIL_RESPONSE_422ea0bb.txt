Subject: Re: Universal Tuya Zigbee v4.9.53 - Need More Details

Hi there,

Thank you for your diagnostic report for Universal Tuya Zigbee v4.9.53!

However, I need more information to help you properly. The log you submitted only shows the app initialization (all drivers loading at startup), but doesn't include any device-specific activity or error messages.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📋 PLEASE PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1️⃣ WHICH DEVICE is having the issue?
   • USB outlet (2-port? 3-port?)
   • Wall switch (3-gang? 4-gang? 6-gang?)
   • Motion sensor?
   • Other device type?
   • Brand and model if known

2️⃣ WHAT EXACTLY is the problem?
   • Device not pairing at all?
   • Only 1 button showing instead of multiple?
   • Buttons not responding when pressed?
   • Device goes offline?
   • Other issue?

3️⃣ IMPORTANT: Did you RE-PAIR the device after updating to v4.9.53?

   ⚠️ THIS IS CRITICAL ⚠️
   
   v4.9.53 includes a MAJOR FIX for multi-gang devices that were only showing 1 button instead of 2, 3, 4, or 6 buttons.
   
   However, devices paired on OLDER VERSIONS (v4.9.50, v4.9.51, v4.9.52) MUST be removed and re-paired to get the fix.
   
   📝 TO RE-PAIR:
   ✅ Remove device from Homey (Settings → Devices → Delete)
   ✅ Factory reset the physical device (hold button 5-10 seconds until LED flashes rapidly)
   ✅ Add device again in Homey app
   ✅ Select correct driver type
   ✅ Complete pairing
   
4️⃣ SEND A NEW DIAGNOSTIC with device activity:
   • Pair a device, OR
   • Use the device (turn on/off), THEN
   • Submit diagnostic immediately
   
   (Current log only has app startup, no device activity)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ EXPECTED BEHAVIOR IN v4.9.53:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

After re-pairing on v4.9.53:
• USB 2-port outlet → Shows 2 buttons (Port 1, Port 2)
• USB 3-port outlet → Shows 3 buttons (Port 1, Port 2, Port 3)
• 3-gang switch → Shows 3 buttons (Switch 1, 2, 3)
• 4-gang switch → Shows 4 buttons (Switch 1, 2, 3, 4)
• 6-gang switch → Shows 6 buttons (Switch 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

Each button should control its respective port/switch independently.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔍 WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR IN THE NEW LOGS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The new v4.9.53 code includes ultra-verbose logging like this:

🔌 Configuring Port 1 (endpoint 1)...
  - Capability onoff exists
  - Registering with CLUSTER.ON_OFF on endpoint 1
[OK] ✅ Port 1 configured successfully

🔌 Configuring Port 2 (endpoint 2)...
  - Capability onoff.usb2 exists
  - Registering with CLUSTER.ON_OFF on endpoint 2
[OK] ✅ Port 2 configured successfully

If these logs are NOT appearing, it means:
• Device was paired on an older version and needs re-pairing
• OR device doesn't match the expected driver
• OR there's a specific issue I need to investigate

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Once you provide this information, I can give you specific help! If the issue persists even after re-pairing on v4.9.53, I'll investigate immediately and create a fix if needed.

Thank you for your patience and for helping test the latest version!
