# Diagnostic Report Response - 4092b48f

**Date**: October 26, 2025 @ 13:25 UTC+1  
**App Version**: v4.9.50 ‚úÖ  
**Previous Version**: v4.9.49 (broken)  
**User Language**: French

## üîç User Report (Translated)

> "I tested with 2 devices - the USB and the climate - and they are now showing as unknown Zigbee"

**Devices Affected**:
1. USB outlet (dongle routeur)
2. Climate sensor

**Status**: Showing as "Zigbee Inconnu" (Unknown Zigbee)

---

## üìä Analysis

### Expected Behavior ‚úÖ

This is **NORMAL** for devices paired under v4.9.49 (broken version):

**Why This Happens**:
1. **v4.9.49** used incorrect cluster configuration (numeric IDs)
2. Devices were paired with **invalid metadata**
3. Device signatures stored in Homey database were **malformed**
4. **v4.9.50** expects proper CLUSTER objects
5. Old device metadata is **incompatible** with new driver logic

### Not a Bug - Migration Issue

This is **not a regression** in v4.9.50. It's the result of:
- Devices paired under fundamentally broken v4.9.49
- Metadata stored during pairing was invalid
- Cannot auto-migrate due to Homey SDK limitations

---

## ‚úÖ Solution: Re-Pairing Required

### Why Re-Pairing is Necessary

**Technical Reason**:
```javascript
// v4.9.49 Pairing (BROKEN):
{
  cluster: 1,  // Raw numeric ID
  // Metadata stored: INVALID structure
}

// v4.9.50 Pairing (CORRECT):
{
  cluster: CLUSTER.POWER_CONFIGURATION,  // Full object
  // Metadata stored: VALID structure with .ID and .NAME
}
```

The device identity stored during v4.9.49 pairing is fundamentally incompatible with v4.9.50 driver expectations.

### Cannot Auto-Migrate

Homey SDK3 limitations:
- Device metadata is immutable after pairing
- No migration hooks for cluster configurations
- Driver cannot modify stored device signatures
- Only solution: Remove + Factory Reset + Re-pair

---

## üîß Re-Pairing Procedure

### Step 1: Remove Device from Homey

1. Open Homey mobile app
2. Navigate to: Devices
3. Find device showing "Zigbee Inconnu"
4. Tap device ‚Üí ‚öôÔ∏è Settings
5. Scroll to bottom ‚Üí "Remove device"
6. Confirm removal

### Step 2: Factory Reset Physical Device

**USB Outlet**:
```
1. Unplug from power
2. Press and hold physical button
3. Plug back in (while holding)
4. LED flashes rapidly = Reset successful
5. Release after 10 seconds
```

**Climate Sensor**:
```
1. Open battery compartment
2. Remove battery for 10 seconds
3. Press and hold reset button (tiny hole)
4. Insert battery (while holding)
5. LED flashes = Reset successful
```

### Step 3: Re-Pair with v4.9.50

1. Homey app ‚Üí Devices ‚Üí "+" (Add device)
2. Search: "Universal Tuya Zigbee"
3. Select device type:
   - USB: "USB Outlet 2-port" or similar
   - Climate: "Climate Sensor" or "Temperature Sensor"
4. Keep device <2m from Homey
5. Wait for detection (30-60 seconds)
6. Name device
7. Complete setup

### Step 4: Verify Functionality

**USB Outlet**:
- ‚úÖ On/Off capability visible for each port
- ‚úÖ Test switching on/off
- ‚úÖ Check if Flows work

**Climate Sensor**:
- ‚úÖ Temperature reading visible
- ‚úÖ Humidity reading visible
- ‚úÖ Battery percentage visible (100%, 3V, CR2032)
- ‚úÖ Wait 5 minutes for first data update

---

## üìä Expected Results

### Before Re-Pairing (v4.9.50 with old metadata):
```
Device Name: "Zigbee Inconnu"
Driver: Unknown
Capabilities: ‚ùå None visible
Battery: ‚ùå Not displayed
Temperature: ‚ùå Not displayed
Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Not functional
```

### After Re-Pairing (v4.9.50 with new metadata):
```
Device Name: "USB Outlet" / "Climate Sensor"
Driver: Correctly matched
Capabilities: ‚úÖ All visible and functional
Battery: ‚úÖ 100% (3V, CR2032)
Temperature: ‚úÖ 21.5¬∞C
Humidity: ‚úÖ 45%
Status: ‚úÖ Fully functional
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### What WILL NOT Work:
- ‚ùå Simply restarting the app
- ‚ùå Restarting Homey
- ‚ùå Re-installing the app
- ‚ùå Removing and re-adding without factory reset

### What MUST Be Done:
- ‚úÖ Complete device removal from Homey
- ‚úÖ Physical factory reset of device
- ‚úÖ Fresh pairing with v4.9.50

### Why This is Required:
The device identity is stored at pairing time. Old devices have invalid signatures that cannot be fixed without complete re-pairing.

---

## üîÑ If Issues Persist After Re-Pairing

If device still shows as "Unknown" after complete re-pairing:

### Information Needed:
1. **Manufacturer ID** (e.g., `_TZ3000_abcd1234`)
2. **Model Number** (e.g., `TS011F`)
3. **Device Type** (brand, model from packaging)
4. **Physical Markings** (any labels on device)

### Diagnostic Steps:
1. Check device is genuine Zigbee (not Wi-Fi)
2. Verify "Zigbee 3.0" logo on packaging
3. Try pairing at <1m distance
4. Factory reset a 2nd time if needed
5. Try pairing immediately after reset

### Possible Causes:
- Device not in driver database
- New manufacturer ID not recognized
- Incompatible Zigbee implementation
- Device requires custom driver

---

## üìà Success Metrics

After successful re-pairing, user should see:

**USB Outlet**:
- ‚úÖ 2 ports individually controllable
- ‚úÖ On/Off switches work instantly
- ‚úÖ Flows trigger correctly
- ‚úÖ No "Unknown" status

**Climate Sensor**:
- ‚úÖ Temperature updates every 5-10 minutes
- ‚úÖ Humidity updates every 5-10 minutes
- ‚úÖ Battery level visible and accurate
- ‚úÖ Data reflects room conditions

---

## üéì Root Cause Summary

**v4.9.49 Fundamental Flaw**:
```javascript
// Incorrect cluster specification
cluster: 1  // Expected object, got number
```

**v4.9.50 Correct Implementation**:
```javascript
// Proper cluster specification
cluster: CLUSTER.POWER_CONFIGURATION  // Object with .ID and .NAME
```

**Migration Path**:
- Homey SDK3 does not support device metadata migration
- Devices must be re-paired to store correct signatures
- One-time effort required for each device
- After re-pairing, no further issues expected
