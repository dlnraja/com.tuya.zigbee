feat: MEGA enrichment system - Complete clusters, DP, endpoints

MEGA ENRICHMENT COMPLETE:

Enriched everything with ALL sources available:
- ✅ Complete Zigbee standard clusters
- ✅ Tuya Data Points (DP) mapping
- ✅ Multi-gang endpoints configuration
- ✅ Complete capabilities
- ✅ WITHOUT REMOVING ANYTHING - Only enriching!

CLUSTERS ENRICHED:

Basic (all devices):
- 0: Basic (device info)
- 1: Power Configuration (battery)
- 3: Identify
- 4: Groups
- 5: Scenes

Control:
- 6: On/Off
- 8: Level Control (dimming)
- 0x0100: Window Covering (curtains)
- 0x0201: Thermostat
- 0x0300: Color Control (RGB)

Measurement:
- 0x0400: Illuminance
- 0x0402: Temperature
- 0x0405: Humidity
- 0x0406: Occupancy (motion)
- 0x0500: IAS Zone (security)
- 0x0702: Metering (energy)
- 0x0B04: Electrical Measurement

Tuya:
- 0xEF00: Tuya Specific (DP)

DATA POINTS (DP) CONFIGURED:

Switches: DP 1-7
Dimming: DP 10, 20-25
Curtains: DP 101-105
Climate: DP 1, 2, 3, 13, 15, 18
Power: DP 6, 18, 19
Battery: DP 104, 105

ENDPOINTS CONFIGURED:

Multi-gang automatic detection:
- 1 gang: 1 endpoint (full clusters)
- 2 gang: 2 endpoints
- 3 gang: 3 endpoints
- 4-8 gang: up to 8 endpoints

Pattern:
- EP1: Clusters [0,1,3,4,5,6] + bindings [6]
- EP2-N: Clusters [6] + bindings [6]

CAPABILITIES ADDED:

Auto-detection and addition of missing capabilities:
- Switches: onoff (+ multi-gang)
- Dimmers: onoff, dim
- RGB: onoff, dim, light_hue, light_saturation, light_temperature
- Motion: alarm_motion, measure_luminance, measure_battery
- Climate: measure_temperature, measure_humidity, measure_co2, etc.
- Plugs: onoff, measure_power, measure_current, measure_voltage
- Thermostat: target_temperature, measure_temperature

DETECTION:

Automatic detection:
- Device type (from name)
- Number of gangs (for switches)
- Power source (battery vs AC)
- Appropriate category
