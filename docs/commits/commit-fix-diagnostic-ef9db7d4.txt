fix: Diagnostic ef9db7d4 - Motion sensor and SOS button battery/readings

DIAGNOSTIC ID: ef9db7d4-331e-492b-99bf-2d85993c0d21
USER MESSAGE: "Still no readings and battery indicator at all on both devices"
APP VERSION: v3.1.8
HOMEY VERSION: v12.8.0

DEVICES AFFECTED:
1. motion_temp_humidity_illumination_multi_battery (0b14ceae-0b7a-4177-b85c-90d148cf464a)
2. sos_emergency_button_cr2032 (284e47cb-a706-40ef-954f-1cb9bbbdb8ee)

ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED:
1. ❌ this.homey.zigbee.getIeeeAddress is not a function
   → API changed in SDK3, method doesn't exist anymore
   
2. ❌ expected_cluster_id_number
   → registerCapability() requires NUMERIC cluster IDs, not strings

FIXES APPLIED:

motion_temp_humidity_illumination_multi_battery:
✅ Fixed IEEE address retrieval:
   OLD: await this.homey.zigbee.getIeeeAddress()
   NEW: this.zclNode.ieeeAddress (SDK3 compatible)

✅ Fixed battery cluster ID:
   OLD: this.registerCapability('measure_battery', 'genPowerCfg', {...})
   NEW: this.registerCapability('measure_battery', 1, {...})

sos_emergency_button_cr2032:
✅ Fixed onOff cluster ID:
   OLD: this.registerCapability('onoff', 'genOnOff', {...})
   NEW: this.registerCapability('onoff', 6, {...})

✅ Battery already had numeric ID (1) - OK

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- SDK3 requires numeric cluster IDs in registerCapability()
- this.zclNode.ieeeAddress is the correct way to get IEEE address in SDK3
- Cluster IDs: genPowerCfg=1, genOnOff=6, iasZone=1280

EXPECTED RESULT:
✅ Motion, temperature, humidity, illuminance readings should appear
✅ Battery percentage should be visible
✅ Button clicks should be detected

USER INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Wait for next app update (will be published automatically)
2. Or: Remove and re-add both devices to force re-initialization
3. Readings and battery should appear immediately after

Script created: fix-diagnostic-ef9db7d4.js (reusable for similar issues)

Issue will be resolved in next published version.
