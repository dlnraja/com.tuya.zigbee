ci: Disable custom workflow - use Homey official GitHub Actions

ISSUE: homey-publish.yml workflow was using incorrect Homey CLI method
The correct approach is to use Athom's official GitHub Actions.

CHANGES:
❌ Disabled: homey-publish.yml (custom workflow)
   - Was using incorrect: homey login --token
   - Kept for reference only (workflow_dispatch)

✅ Active: homey-official-publish.yml (official Athom workflow)
   - Uses: athombv/github-action-homey-app-validate@master
   - Uses: athombv/github-action-homey-app-version@master
   - Uses: athombv/github-action-homey-app-publish@master
   - Correct authentication: personal_access_token

OFFICIAL WORKFLOW PIPELINE:
1. update-docs: Update links, paths, README, CHANGELOG
2. validate: Validate app at debug level
3. version: Auto-increment patch version
4. publish: Publish to Homey App Store

ATHOM OFFICIAL ACTIONS:
- athombv/github-action-homey-app-validate
- athombv/github-action-homey-app-version
- athombv/github-action-homey-app-publish

These are the official Athom-provided GitHub Actions
for Homey app automation, not custom Homey CLI commands.

AUTHENTICATION:
Uses: personal_access_token: ${{ secrets.HOMEY_TOKEN }}
This is the correct way for Athom official actions.

TRIGGER:
Triggers on push to master (excluding docs, reports, scripts)
Can also be manually triggered via workflow_dispatch

RESULT:
✅ Fully automated CI/CD pipeline using official Athom tools
✅ No manual Homey CLI commands needed
✅ Proper authentication via GitHub secrets
✅ Auto-versioning and publishing

The custom homey-publish.yml is now disabled (manual only).
All automation goes through homey-official-publish.yml.
