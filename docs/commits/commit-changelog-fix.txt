fix: Add missing CHANGELOG entries for v3.0.1-v3.0.8 to fix Homey publish

Problem:
Homey publish workflow failed with error:
"Missing changelog for v3.0.5, and running in headless mode"

Solution:
Added complete changelog entries for all versions from 3.0.1 to 3.0.8:
- v3.0.8: Documentation & Workflows Complete
- v3.0.7: Complete Documentation & Final Synthesis  
- v3.0.6: Workflows - Concurrency Control (Definitive Solution)
- v3.0.5: Workflows - Pull Rebase & Retry Logic
- v3.0.4: MEGA IMPLEMENTATION - Sprints 2-4 Complete
- v3.0.3: Professional Documentation
- v3.0.2: CI Workflows Fixed
- v3.0.1: MEGA IMPLEMENTATION - Sprint 1

Each entry includes proper sections:
- Added: New features/files
- Fixed: Bug fixes and improvements
- Changed: Modifications

This allows the Homey publish workflow to complete successfully.

Status: Ready for Homey App Store publication
Version: 3.0.8
