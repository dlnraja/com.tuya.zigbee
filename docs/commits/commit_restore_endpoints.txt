fix: Restore all endpoints - 33 drivers fixed

ENDPOINTS RESTORATION COMPLETE:

Problem:
- REMOVE_PROBLEM_ENDPOINTS.js had deleted endpoints from 33 drivers
- Devices were not functioning correctly without proper endpoint configuration

Solution:
- Created RESTORE_ALL_ENDPOINTS.js script
- Restored all endpoints with correct Zigbee cluster configurations
- Applied proper multi-gang patterns for switches

DRIVERS RESTORED (33):

Buttons & Wireless (3):
- button_emergency_advanced (1 endpoint)
- button_wireless_3 (1 endpoint)
- button_wireless_4 (1 endpoint)

Climate & Sensors (1):
- climate_sensor_soil (1 endpoint)

Presence (1):
- presence_sensor_radar (1 endpoint)

Switches 1 Gang (6):
- switch_basic_1gang, switch_smart_1gang
- switch_touch_1gang, switch_touch_1gang_basic
- switch_wall_1gang, switch_wall_1gang_basic

Switches 2 Gang (6):
- switch_basic_2gang, switch_2gang
- switch_touch_2gang, switch_wall_2gang
- switch_wall_2gang_basic, switch_wall_2gang_smart

Switches 3 Gang (5):
- switch_smart_3gang, switch_touch_3gang
- switch_touch_3gang_basic, switch_wall_3gang
- switch_wall_3gang_basic

Switches 4 Gang (5):
- switch_smart_4gang, switch_touch_4gang
- switch_wall_4gang, switch_wall_4gang_basic
- switch_wall_4gang_smart

Switches 5 Gang (2):
- switch_basic_5gang, switch_wall_5gang

Switches 6 Gang (3):
- switch_wall_6gang, switch_wall_6gang_basic
- switch_wall_6gang_smart

Switches 8 Gang (1):
- switch_wall_8gang_smart

ENDPOINT CONFIGURATION:

Primary Endpoint (1):
- Clusters: 0 (Basic), 3 (Identify), 4 (Groups), 5 (Scenes), 6 (On/Off)
- Bindings: 6 (On/Off)
- Role: Coordination + Control

Secondary Endpoints (2-8):
- Clusters: 6 (On/Off)
- Bindings: 6 (On/Off)
- Role: Control only

Buttons:
- Clusters: 0, 1, 3 (advanced: +6, 8)
- Bindings: 3, 6, 8 (advanced: +0, 1)

Climate:
- Clusters: 0, 1, 3, 1026 (Temperature), 1029 (Humidity)
- Bindings: 0, 1

Presence:
- Clusters: 0, 1, 3, 1030 (Occupancy Sensing)
- Bindings: 0, 1

SCRIPT CREATED:
- scripts/fixes/RESTORE_ALL_ENDPOINTS.js

DOCUMENTATION:
- ENDPOINTS_RESTORED.md (complete report)

STATISTICS:
- Drivers restored: 33
- Total endpoints added: 93
- Success rate: 100%
