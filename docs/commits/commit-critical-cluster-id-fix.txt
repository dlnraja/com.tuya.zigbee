fix(critical): Fix cluster ID NaN errors causing device initialization failures

CRITICAL FIX - Multiple users affected with completely non-functional devices

Problem Reports:
- Log ID: cf19866c-1fc1-4c53-ba44-f87e05df41d3 (v3.0.7)
- User message: "No readings at all, no data, no battery and no triggers"
- Error: TypeError: expected_cluster_id_number
- Impact: Motion sensors, SOS buttons completely broken

Root Cause:
Using literal cluster ID numbers (1, 1024, 1026, etc.) instead of CLUSTER constants
caused Homey ZigBee Driver to fail validation with NaN errors.

Example error log:
```
Endpoint 1 clusters: basic (0xNaN), powerConfiguration (0xNaN), ...
TypeError: expected_cluster_id_number
at assertClusterSpecification
```

Fix Applied:
Changed from literal numbers to CLUSTER constants in device.js files:

BEFORE (BROKEN):
```javascript
this.registerCapability('measure_temperature', 1026, { ... });
this.registerCapability('measure_battery', 1, { ... });
```

AFTER (FIXED):
```javascript
this.registerCapability('measure_temperature', CLUSTER.TEMPERATURE_MEASUREMENT, { ... });
this.registerCapability('measure_battery', CLUSTER.POWER_CONFIGURATION, { ... });
```

Files Modified:
- drivers/motion_temp_humidity_illumination_multi_battery/device.js
  * measure_temperature: 1026 → CLUSTER.TEMPERATURE_MEASUREMENT
  * measure_humidity: 1029 → CLUSTER.RELATIVE_HUMIDITY
  * measure_luminance: 1024 → CLUSTER.ILLUMINANCE_MEASUREMENT
  * measure_battery: 1 → CLUSTER.POWER_CONFIGURATION

- drivers/sos_emergency_button_cr2032/device.js
  * measure_battery: 1 → CLUSTER.POWER_CONFIGURATION

Documentation Added:
- docs/troubleshooting/CRITICAL_USER_REPORTS_IAS_ZONE.md
  * Complete analysis of user reports
  * Root cause investigation
  * Impact assessment
  
- docs/troubleshooting/FIX_CRITICAL_IAS_ZONE_CLUSTER_IDS.md
  * Detailed fix documentation
  * Before/After comparison
  * Developer checklist
  * Rollout plan for remaining drivers

Impact:
BEFORE FIX:
❌ Motion sensors: No readings, no triggers
❌ SOS buttons: No alarms, no data
❌ Temperature/Humidity: No data
❌ Battery: No data
❌ Device initialization: Complete failure

AFTER FIX:
✅ Motion sensors: Detect motion correctly
✅ SOS buttons: Trigger alarms properly
✅ Temperature/Humidity: Report data
✅ Battery: Report percentage
✅ Device initialization: Success
✅ IAS Zone enrollment: Works with fallbacks

Affected Users:
Multiple users with motion sensors and SOS buttons experiencing complete device failure.
This fix restores full functionality.

Testing:
✅ Validated cluster constant usage
✅ Confirmed device initialization succeeds
✅ Verified all capabilities register correctly
✅ IAS Zone enrollment works

Next Steps:
Phase 2: Audit all remaining IAS Zone drivers for same issue
Phase 3: Audit ALL drivers for literal cluster IDs
Goal: Replace ALL literal IDs with CLUSTER constants

Breaking Changes: None
Migration Required: None - automatic on app update

Version: 3.0.13
Priority: CRITICAL
Status: TESTED & READY FOR DEPLOYMENT
