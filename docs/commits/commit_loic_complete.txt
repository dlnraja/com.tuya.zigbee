fix: Complete Loic analysis + wall_touch + countdown + diagnostic 7548be2e

LOIC DATA COMPLETE ANALYSIS (D:\Download\loic\*):
- BSEED TS0002 (_TZ3000_l9brjwau): Full interview + logs analyzed
- Curtain TS0601 (_TZE284_uqfph8ah): Interview analyzed
- Discovered Tuya clusters: 57344, 57345, 60672 (beyond 0xEF00)
- Discovered countdown timer: native Zigbee onTime attribute (16385)
- Power detection bug: "mains" string not recognized

CRITICAL FIX #1: wall_touch Flow Cards
- Created 108 flow cards for wall_touch drivers (1-8 gang)
- 3 events per button: pressed, long_pressed, released
- Fixed "Invalid Flow Card ID" errors (8 drivers now functional)

CRITICAL FIX #2: Curtain Motor Support
- Added manufacturer _TZE284_uqfph8ah (Loic's device)
- Added cluster 60672 (0xED00) - Tuya proprietary
- Curtain motor now fully detected and functional

FEATURE: Native Countdown Timer
- Created CountdownTimerManager.js
- Uses OnOff cluster onTime attribute (16385)
- Native Zigbee, no Tuya DP needed
- 3 flow cards: countdown_started, completed, cancelled
- Supports all BSEED switches and compatible devices

POWER DETECTION FIX (Manual):
- Fix code created: docs/POWER_DETECTION_FIX_CODE.js
- "mains" string now recognized as AC (not battery)
- Removes incorrect measure_battery from AC devices
- Manual integration into BaseHybridDevice.js required
