fix: GitHub Actions workflow - Add pull rebase and retry logic

Fixed workflow "Update Documentation & Links" failing with push rejected error.

Issue:
- Workflow failed with: "! [rejected] master -> master (fetch first)"
- Caused by concurrent pushes creating race condition
- Remote had changes that local didn't have

Solution:
✅ Added git pull --rebase before push
✅ Implemented retry logic (3 attempts with 5s delay)
✅ Sync with remote changes automatically

Changes to .github/workflows/update-docs.yml:
- Pull rebase before push to sync remote changes
- Retry loop (3 attempts) if push fails
- Auto-sync between retries
- Clear success/failure messages

Benefits:
- Handles concurrent workflow runs gracefully
- No more push rejected errors
- Automatic conflict resolution via rebase
- Resilient to timing issues

Testing:
- Next workflow run will pull before push
- Retry logic activates if push fails
- Maximum 3 attempts with auto-sync

Version: 3.0.5
Status: Workflow fixed and ready
