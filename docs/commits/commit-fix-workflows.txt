fix: Update GitHub Actions workflows to use upload-artifact@v4

Fixed deprecation errors in CI workflows:
- Updated actions/upload-artifact from v3 to v4 in ci-validation.yml (5 occurrences)
- Updated actions/upload-artifact from v3 to v4 in ci-complete.yml (7 occurrences)

Context:
GitHub Actions deprecated upload-artifact@v3 on April 16, 2024.
All workflows were failing with error:
"This request has been automatically failed because it uses a deprecated version of actions/upload-artifact: v3"

Files modified:
- .github/workflows/ci-validation.yml
  - Upload Validation Report
  - Upload ESLint Report
