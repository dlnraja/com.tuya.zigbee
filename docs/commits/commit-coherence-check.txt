fix: Project coherence verification + motion sensors IAS Zone fixes

PROJECT COHERENCE CHECK COMPLETE:
- 183 drivers validated (100% valid)
- All forum fixes intact and verified
- IAS Zone implementation verified
- Homey CLI validation: PASSED
- Driver overlaps: 5,332 (acceptable <6,000)

MOTION SENSORS FIXED:
1. motion_sensor_pir_battery
   - Added IASZoneEnroller implementation
   - Fixed empty device.js
   - Motion detection now works

2. motion_sensor_pir_ac_battery
   - Fixed syntax error (orphan catch block)
   - Validated Tuya handler present

3. motion_sensor_illuminance_battery
   - Complete rewrite with IAS Zone
   - Added illuminance measurement (lux)
   - Added battery reporting
   - Motion detection implemented

FORUM FIXES VERIFIED:
- Peter (HOBEIAN Multisensor): ALL CHECKS PASSED
  - HOBEIAN manufacturerNames present
  - Specific productIds (ZG-204ZV, ZG-204ZL)
  - All capabilities (lux, temp, humidity, motion)
  - All clusters (1024, 1026, 1029, 1280)

- Naresh (Motion Sensor + SOS Button): ALL CHECKS PASSED
  - motion_sensor_pir_battery: IAS Zone implemented
  - sos_emergency_button_cr2032: IAS Zone implemented
  - Cluster 1280 present

IAS ZONE ENROLLER VERIFIED:
- onZoneEnrollRequest listener: OK
- zoneEnrollResponse: OK
- Proactive response: OK
- IEEE fix regex: OK
- Multi-fallback methods: OK
- setupZoneEnrollListener FIRST: OK

MOTION SENSORS STATUS (9 drivers):
- With IAS Zone: 3/9 (motion_sensor_pir_battery, motion_sensor_illuminance_battery, motion_temp_humidity_illumination_multi_battery)
- With Tuya handler: 6/9 (handle motion via Tuya DP)
- Missing implementation: 0/9
