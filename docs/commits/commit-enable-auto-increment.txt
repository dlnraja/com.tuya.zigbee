ci: Re-enable automatic version increment for full automation

USER REQUEST: Enable auto-increment versioning

SYSTEM RESTORED: Automatic patch version increment on every push

WORKFLOW CHANGES:

version step now:
✅ Uses athombv/github-action-homey-app-version@master
✅ Auto-increments patch version (3.1.9 → 3.1.10 → 3.1.11, etc.)
✅ Generates standardized changelog automatically
✅ Commits version change back to repo with [skip ci]
✅ Creates GitHub Release automatically
✅ Pushes tags to repository

BENEFITS OF AUTO-INCREMENT:
- ✅ Zero manual version management
- ✅ Every push to master = new release
- ✅ Fully automated CI/CD pipeline
- ✅ Standardized changelog generation
- ✅ No version conflicts (always increments)
- ✅ Developer can focus on code, not versions

AUTOMATED CHANGELOG:
Every release includes:
- 190 native drivers
- 12,563+ manufacturer IDs
- 25+ major brands
- 96%+ market coverage
- 100% local control
- Link to full changelog

PROCESS NOW:
1. Make changes (fix bugs, add features)
2. Commit & push to master
3. GitHub Actions automatically:
   - Validates app
   - Increments version
   - Publishes to Homey App Store
   - Commits version back
   - Creates GitHub Release

NO MANUAL INTERVENTION NEEDED!

DOCUMENTATION UPDATED:
docs/workflow/VERSION_MANAGEMENT.md now reflects auto-increment system

RESULT:
✅ Fully automated release pipeline
✅ Push to master = automatic publication
✅ Version management handled by workflow
✅ Professional CI/CD automation

This is the standard Athom-recommended approach for continuous delivery.
