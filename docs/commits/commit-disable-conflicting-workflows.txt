ci: Disable all conflicting workflows - keep only homey-official-publish

ISSUE: Multiple workflows triggering simultaneously causing conflicts
The workflow "Auto-Publish to Homey App Store" (#23) was triggered instead of official

WORKFLOWS DISABLED:
❌ auto-publish.yml → auto-publish.yml.disabled
❌ auto-publish-improved.yml → auto-publish-improved.yml.disabled
❌ homey-publish.yml → homey-publish.yml.disabled (already had issues)
❌ build-and-validate.yml → build-and-validate.yml.disabled
❌ complete-automation.yml → complete-automation.yml.disabled
❌ complete-validation.yml → complete-validation.yml.disabled

WORKFLOW ACTIVE (ONLY ONE):
✅ homey-official-publish.yml (Athom official GitHub Actions)

REASON:
Having multiple workflows with overlapping triggers causes:
- Race conditions
- Conflicting publishes
- Version increment conflicts
- Validation running multiple times
- Resource waste

OFFICIAL WORKFLOW PIPELINE:
homey-official-publish.yml handles everything:
1. update-docs: Auto-update links, paths, README
2. validate: Validate app at publish level
3. version: Auto-increment version (patch)
4. publish: Publish to Homey App Store

TRIGGERS:
- Push to master (excluding docs, reports, scripts)
- Manual trigger (workflow_dispatch)

OTHER WORKFLOWS KEPT:
✅ diagnostic.yml (on-demand diagnostics)
✅ pr-validation.yml (PR checks only)
✅ update-docs.yml (manual docs updates)
✅ validate.yml (manual validation)
✅ bi-monthly-auto-enrichment.yml (scheduled, not on push)
✅ monthly-auto-enrichment.yml (scheduled, not on push)
✅ weekly-enrichment.yml (scheduled, not on push)
✅ scheduled-issues-scan.yml (scheduled, not on push)

RESULT:
✅ No more conflicting workflows
✅ Single source of truth: homey-official-publish.yml
✅ Clean CI/CD pipeline
✅ No race conditions
✅ Predictable behavior

Next push will trigger ONLY the official Athom workflow.
