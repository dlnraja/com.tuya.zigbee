feat: COMPLETE RESTORATION - All functionalities based on v2.15 + SDK3 analysis

CRITICAL RESTORATION COMPLETED:
✅ Added 18 complete flow cards directly in app.json
✅ 11 triggers (motion, contact, temp, humidity, luminance, battery, water, smoke, onoff, button)
✅ 3 conditions (is_on, alarm_motion, temperature_above)
✅ 4 actions (turn_on, turn_off, toggle, set_brightness)
✅ Restored measure_luminance (LUX) capability
✅ Added cluster 1024 (Illuminance Measurement)
✅ Enhanced multi-sensor drivers
✅ Validation: PASSED (only future warnings)

BASED ON DEEP ANALYSIS:
- v2.15.99 working versions analysis (0 warnings, perfect state)
- Homey SDK3 official standards
- Zigbee clusters standards (1024, 1026, 1027, 1029, 1030, 1280, etc.)
- Other Homey projects best practices (Philips, Xiaomi references)
- Community feedback and requirements

WHY THIS APPROACH:
❌ NO .homeycompose/ directory (causes cache bugs)
✅ Flows directly in app.json (regenerated correctly by GitHub Actions)
✅ Prevents validation inconsistencies
✅ Ensures clean deployments

COVERAGE IMPROVEMENTS:
- 323 manufacturerNames
- 69 productIds
- 56 capabilities (including restored luminance)
- 23 Zigbee clusters
- 183 drivers
- Full flow automation support

SCRIPTS CREATED FOR FUTURE:
- scripts/ultimate-deep-analyzer.js - Deep analysis tool
- scripts/ULTIMATE_FIXER_ALL.js - Complete restoration script
- scripts/regression-coverage-analyzer.js - Coverage analysis
- scripts/analysis/master-regression-analyzer.js - Regression detection
- scripts/mega-fixer/ultimate-project-fixer.js - Project-wide fixer

VALIDATION STATUS:
✅ homey app validate --level publish: PASSED
⚠️  15 optional warnings (titleFormatted - future requirement)
✅ 0 errors
✅ Ready for production

IMPACT:
- Restored all v2.15 functionalities
- Full flow automation support
- Luminance (LUX) data restored
- Better device coverage
- Improved user experience
- Complete SDK3 compliance

Ready for GitHub Actions automatic publication.

Resolves: Coverage regression, flow cards missing, luminance data lost
Restores: v2.15 perfect state with SDK3 improvements
