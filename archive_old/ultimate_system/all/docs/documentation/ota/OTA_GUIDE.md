# OTA Firmware Updates - Ultimate Zigbee Hub

## Overview

The Ultimate Zigbee Hub supports **Over-The-Air (OTA)** firmware updates using native Homey SDK3 features. This allows automatic updating of Zigbee device firmware for improved functionality and security.

## How It Works

### Native SDK3 Integration
- Uses `ZigBeeOTADevice` class from `homey-zigbeedriver`
- Automatic firmware file management
- Built-in safety checks and validation
- User notifications for update status

### Supported Manufacturers
- Tuya
- MOES
- OneNuo
- BSeed
- TOMZN
- WoodUPP
- Insoma

### Firmware File Formats
- .ota
- .bin
- .hex

## For Users

### Enabling OTA Updates
1. Go to device settings
2. Find "Firmware Updates (OTA)" section
3. Enable "Auto-update firmware" or "Notify about updates"

### Update Process
1. When firmware is available, you'll receive a notification
2. Updates happen automatically (if enabled) or manually
3. Device shows updating status during process
4. Notification confirms successful completion

### Safety Features
- **Checksum Validation**: Ensures firmware integrity
- **Manufacturer Verification**: Only compatible firmware is installed
- **Automatic Backup**: Device settings preserved
- **Rollback Support**: Can revert if update fails

## For Developers

### Implementation
Each driver extends `ZigBeeOTADevice`:

```javascript
const { ZigBeeOTADevice } = require('homey-zigbeedriver');

class MyDevice extends ZigBeeOTADevice {
    async onOTAUpdate() {
        this.log('OTA update started');
        // Homey handles the process
    }
    
    async onOTAUpdateCompleted() {
        this.log('Update completed successfully');
        // Notify user
    }
}
```

### Firmware Sources
- **Zigbee2MQTT**: https://zigbee2mqtt.io/firmware/
- **Blakadder**: https://blakadder.com/zigbee-ota/
- **Manufacturer Channels**: Official firmware releases

### Adding Firmware Files
1. Place in `ota-firmware/[manufacturer]/` directory
2. Update `versions.json` with device compatibility
3. Include checksum for validation
4. Test thoroughly before deployment

## Security & Safety

### Validation Process
- File size limits (50MB max)
- SHA256 checksum verification
- Manufacturer compatibility check
- Device model validation

### Risk Mitigation
- **No Bricking**: Only compatible firmware allowed
- **Backup System**: Settings preserved during update
- **Manual Override**: Users can disable auto-updates
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time update status

## Troubleshooting

### Update Fails
- Check device is powered and connected
- Ensure stable Zigbee network
- Verify firmware compatibility
- Check Homey logs for details

### Device Offline After Update
- Wait for device to restart (can take 2-3 minutes)
- Check if device announced itself back
- Try re-pairing if necessary

## Best Practices

### For Users
- Keep devices powered during updates
- Don't interrupt update process
- Enable notifications for awareness
- Test device functionality after updates

### For Developers
- Validate all firmware files before deployment
- Test updates on development devices first
- Provide clear update descriptions
- Monitor community feedback
