## üî¥ PRODUCTION EMERGENCY

### User-Reported Issues

**Peter_van_Werkhoven (1h ago)**:
> "Still the same issue here, all exclamation marks and can't select them, no reaction when you tap the icon's."

**Naresh_Kodali (6h ago)**:
> "Unfortunately, I am having the same issue as others. Can't add new devices. App settings page doesn't work either."

### Root Cause Identified

**Problem**: app.json file size = **6.3 MB** (ENORMOUS!)
- v2.0.3 enrichment added 1,205 manufacturers to ALL 163 drivers
- Total manufacturer entries: 213,373
- Homey cannot load files this large
- Result: Exclamation marks on all devices, no functionality

## üéØ Intelligent Optimization Strategy

### Per-Category Limits

Instead of 1,205 manufacturers for ALL drivers, we now use intelligent limits:

| Category | Drivers | Limit | Logic |
|----------|---------|-------|-------|
| **Switches** | 56 | 150 | High variety, many manufacturers |
| **Sensors** | 75 | 100 | Medium variety |
| **Lighting** | 9 | 80 | Color/dimming variants |
| **Power** | 7 | 80 | Socket/plug variants |
| **Climate** | 7 | 60 | Thermostat types |
| **Covers** | 2 | 60 | Curtain/blind motors |
| **Specialty** | 5 | 60 | Fans, garage, etc. |
| **Security** | 2 | 50 | Locks, specific models |

### Selection Algorithm

For each driver:
1. **Keep original 20** proven manufacturers (already working)
2. **Pattern match** relevant manufacturers:
   - `_TZ3000_*` for switches
   - `_TZE200_*` for sensors/climate
   - Product ID matches (TS0001-TS0004, TS011F, TS0601, etc.)
3. **Add up to category limit**
4. **Sort alphabetically**
5. **Deduplicate**

**Update Instructions**:
1. Go to Homey App Store
2. Update "Universal Tuya Zigbee" to v2.0.5
3. Restart Homey
4. Exclamation marks should disappear
5. You can now add devices and access settings

**Still Supported**: 18,120 manufacturer IDs across all device types
**Coverage**: Excellent - all major brands and variants

Please let me know if this resolves your issues!
