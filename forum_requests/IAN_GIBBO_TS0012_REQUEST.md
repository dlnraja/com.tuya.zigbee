## üîç RESEARCH CONDUCTED

### 1. Zigbee2MQTT Research

**Source**: https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/devices/TS0012.html

**Key Findings**:
```
Device: Tuya TS0012
Type: 2-Gang Wall Switch (NOT 4-gang as user thought)
Pairing: Hold button 10 seconds until LEDs flash
Router: NO - End device only
Endpoints: 2 (left + right)
```

**Supported Features**:
- State control (left/right)
- Power-on behavior setting
- On with timed off
- Backlight mode control

### 2. Device Verification

**Actual Configuration**:
```
‚úÖ Model: TS0012 (2-gang, not 4-gang)
‚úÖ Manufacturer: _TZ3000_zmlunnhy (NEW - not in database)
‚úÖ Endpoints: 2 (endpoint 1 + endpoint 2)
‚úÖ Clusters: OnOff (6), Groups (4), Scenes (5), Basic (0)
‚úÖ Power: AC powered (device reports "battery" incorrectly)
```

**Driver Match**:
```
Correct driver: switch_wall_2gang ‚úÖ
User thought: switch_wall_4gang ‚ùå
Reason: Device has 2 endpoints = 2 gangs
```

---

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Driver Update

**File**: `drivers/switch_wall_2gang/driver.compose.json`

**Change Made**:
```json
"manufacturerName": [
  // ... existing IDs ...
  "_TZ3000_akqdg6g7",
  "_TZ3000_zmlunnhy"  // ‚Üê ADDED
]
```

**Product ID**: TS0012 (already in list)

### 2. Driver Capabilities

**Automatic Tile Creation**: ‚úÖ YES

The driver already supports dynamic multi-gang switches:
```javascript
capabilities: [
  "onoff",           // Switch 1 (endpoint 1)
  "onoff.switch_2"   // Switch 2 (endpoint 2)
]
```

**Answer to User's Question**:
> "Does your driver create tiles for as many as is needed by the device?"

**YES** - The driver automatically creates:
- 1 tile for Switch 1 (main onoff capability)
- 1 tile for Switch 2 (onoff.switch_2 capability)
- Matches the 2 endpoints of the TS0012 device

## üìä TECHNICAL ANALYSIS

### Cluster Configuration

**Endpoint 1 (Primary)**:
```
Clusters:
  0 (Basic) - Device information
  3 (Identify) - Identification
  4 (Groups) - Group management
  5 (Scenes) - Scene management
  6 (OnOff) - Switch control ‚Üê Main capability

Bindings:
  6 (OnOff) - Report state changes
  1794 (Metering) - Energy reporting (optional)
```

**Endpoint 2 (Secondary)**:
```
Clusters:
  4 (Groups) - Group management
  5 (Scenes) - Scene management
  6 (OnOff) - Switch control ‚Üê Secondary capability

Bindings:
  6 (OnOff) - Report state changes
```

### Power Source Correction

**Device Reports**: `"powerSource": "battery"` ‚ùå

**Actual**: AC Powered (wall switch) ‚úÖ

**Explanation**:
- Some Tuya devices incorrectly report power source
- TS0012 is a wall switch = AC powered
- Driver handles this with "power_source" setting (auto-detect)

---

## üéØ PAIRING INSTRUCTIONS

### For Ian_Gibbo

**Steps to Pair**:
```
1. Install/Update "Universal Tuya Zigbee" app
2. Open Homey app ‚Üí Add Device
3. Select "2-Gang Wall Switch"
4. Put TS0012 in pairing mode:
   ‚Üí Hold button 10 seconds
   ‚Üí Wait until ALL LEDs start flashing
5. Homey will detect device automatically
6. Device will show:
   - Switch 1 (left)
   - Switch 2 (right)
```

**Expected Result**:
- 2 separate tiles in Homey
- Each tile controls one gang
- Independent on/off control

## ‚úÖ TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Ian_Gibbo

**After Update**:
```
1. Update app to latest version (v4.7.2+)
2. Remove old device (if paired)
3. Re-pair device following instructions above
4. Test both switches:
   - Manual control
   - Homey app control
   - Flow automation
5. Verify state reporting:
   - Switch on/off states accurate
   - Both gangs respond independently
```

**Expected Behavior**:
```
‚úÖ Both switches appear as separate tiles
‚úÖ Each switch controls independently
‚úÖ State changes reported instantly
‚úÖ Flows work with both switches
‚úÖ No "4-gang" confusion (it's 2-gang)
```

---

## üìä COMPARISON: 2-Gang vs 4-Gang

### Why This is 2-Gang (Not 4-Gang)

**Ian's Device** (TS0012):
```
Endpoints: 2
  - Endpoint 1 (left switch)
  - Endpoint 2 (right switch)
Gangs: 2
Model: TS0012 (12 = 2 in Tuya nomenclature)
```

**If it was 4-Gang** (TS0004):
```
Endpoints: 4
  - Endpoint 1, 2, 3, 4
Gangs: 4
Model: TS0004 (not TS0012)
```

**Explanation**:
- Number of endpoints = Number of gangs
- TS0012 has 2 endpoints = 2-gang switch
- Driver creates tiles based on endpoints
- User's device will show 2 tiles (not 4)

## üìù NOTES FOR FUTURE

### Similar Requests

**Pattern Identified**:
```
Many users confuse gang count with device capabilities
- Check endpoints count (not manufacturer claims)
- Verify with Zigbee2MQTT database
- Match to correct driver by endpoint count
```

**Quick Reference**:
```
TS0001/TS0011 = 1 endpoint = 1-gang
TS0002/TS0012 = 2 endpoints = 2-gang ‚Üê Ian's device
TS0003/TS0013 = 3 endpoints = 3-gang
TS0004/TS0014 = 4 endpoints = 4-gang
TS0005/TS0015 = 5 endpoints = 5-gang
TS0006/TS0016 = 6 endpoints = 6-gang
```

### Manufacturer ID Pattern

**_TZ3000_zmlunnhy**:
```
Format: _TZ3000_[8 chars]
Series: TZ3000 (common for switches)
Unique: zmlunnhy (this specific manufacturer batch)
```

**Detection**:
- Always verify full manufacturer ID
- Don't truncate or use wildcards
- Each batch may have different firmware
- Add complete ID to driver

## ‚úÖ RESOLUTION SUMMARY

### What Was Done

```
1. ‚úÖ Researched device specifications (Zigbee2MQTT)
2. ‚úÖ Identified correct driver (switch_wall_2gang)
3. ‚úÖ Added manufacturer ID (_TZ3000_zmlunnhy)
4. ‚úÖ Clarified 2-gang vs 4-gang confusion
5. ‚úÖ Confirmed automatic tile creation
6. ‚úÖ Documented complete solution
```

## üìû FORUM RESPONSE TEMPLATE

```markdown
Hi @Ian_Gibbo,

Great news! I've added support for your TS0012 switch (manufacturer ID: _TZ3000_zmlunnhy).

**Clarification**: Your device is a **2-gang switch** (not 4-gang) because it has 2 endpoints. The driver will automatically create 2 separate tiles for you - one for each switch.

**To use it**:
1. Update to latest app version (v4.7.2+)
2. Add device ‚Üí Select "2-Gang Wall Switch"
3. Hold button 10 seconds until LEDs flash
4. Homey will detect it automatically

**Yes, the driver creates tiles automatically** based on the number of endpoints your device has. Your TS0012 has 2 endpoints, so you'll see 2 tiles.

Let me know if you need any help!

Cheers,
dlnraja
