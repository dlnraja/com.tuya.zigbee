## 🔴 DEVICE 1: Temperature Humidity Sensor (MIS-DETECTED)

### Problem Reported

**Device**: Temperature and Humidity Sensor  
**Manufacturer**: `_TZ3000_akqdg6g7`  
**Model**: `TS0201`  
**Issue**: Recognized as **smoke detector** (WRONG!)  
**GitHub Issue**: [#1040](https://github.com/JohanBendz/com.tuya.zigbee/issues/1040)

### Device Interview Analysis

```json
{
  "modelId": "TS0201",
  "manufacturerName": "_TZ3000_akqdg6g7",
  "applicationDeviceId": 770,  // = Temperature Sensor
  "inputClusters": [
    1,     // powerConfiguration (battery)
    3,     // identify
    1026,  // temperatureMeasurement ✅
    1029,  // relativeHumidity ✅
    0      // basic
  ]
}
```

**Technical Data**:
- Battery: 200 (= 100%)
- Temperature: 2226 (= 22.26°C)
- Humidity: 4526 (= 45.26%)
- Device Type: 770 = **Temperature Sensor** (NOT smoke detector!)

### Root Cause

The manufacturer ID `_TZ3000_akqdg6g7` was **incorrectly added** to:
- `drivers/smoke_detector_battery/driver.compose.json`

This caused Homey to recognize it as a smoke detector instead of temp/humidity sensor.

### ✅ FIX APPLIED

**Action 1**: Removed from wrong driver
```diff
# drivers/smoke_detector_battery/driver.compose.json
- "_TZ3000_akqdg6g7",
```

**Action 2**: Added to correct driver
```diff
# drivers/temperature_humidity_sensor_battery/driver.compose.json
+ "_TZ3000_akqdg6g7",
```

**Driver**: `temperature_humidity_sensor_battery`  
**Capabilities**:
- ✅ `measure_temperature` (°C)
- ✅ `measure_humidity` (%)
- ✅ `measure_battery` (%)
- ✅ `temp_alarm` (high/low alerts)

## 🟡 DEVICE 2: Soil Moisture & Temperature Sensor (NOT RECOGNIZED)

### Problem Reported

**Device**: Soil Moisture & Temperature Sensor  
**Manufacturer**: `_TZE284_oitavov2`  
**Model**: `TS0601`  
**Issue**: **Not recognized** at all  
**GitHub Issue**: [#1245](https://github.com/JohanBendz/com.tuya.zigbee/issues/1245)

### Device Interview Analysis

```json
{
  "modelId": "TS0601",
  "manufacturerName": "_TZE284_oitavov2",
  "applicationDeviceId": 81,  // Smart plug (incorrect!)
  "inputClusters": [
    4,      // groups
    5,      // scenes
    61184,  // Tuya EF00 (proprietary) ✅
    0,      // basic
    60672   // Tuya ED80 (proprietary) ✅
  ]
}
```

**Device Purpose**: 
- Soil moisture monitoring
- Soil temperature measurement
- Garden/irrigation automation

**Tuya Proprietary**: Uses cluster 61184 (EF00) for data transmission

### ✅ FIX APPLIED

**Action**: Added manufacturer ID to soil sensor driver

```diff
# drivers/soil_moisture_temperature_sensor_battery/driver.compose.json
+ "_TZE284_oitavov2",
```

**Driver**: `soil_moisture_temperature_sensor_battery`  
**Capabilities**:
- ✅ `measure_temperature` → **Soil Temperature** (°C)
- ✅ `measure_humidity` → **Soil Moisture** (%)
- ✅ `measure_battery` (%)

**Clusters Supported**:
- Cluster 61184 (Tuya EF00) - Data transmission
- Cluster 1024 (Soil moisture)
- Cluster 1030 (Soil temperature)
