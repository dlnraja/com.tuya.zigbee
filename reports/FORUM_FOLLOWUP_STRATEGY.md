## Recommended Enhanced Follow-up

### For Cam - Detailed Troubleshooting Response

**Post this as follow-up**:

```
Hi @Cam,

Let me provide more detailed troubleshooting steps while we wait for the v2.15.72 update:

**1-Button Wireless Scene Switch (Battery)**

The driver exists but might not be visible depending on your app version. In the meantime:

1. **Check your current app version**:
   - Open Homey app â†’ Settings â†’ Apps â†’ Universal Tuya Zigbee
   - What version number do you see?

2. **If you're on v2.15.70 or earlier**, update to v2.15.72 when available (releasing soon)

3. **Critical pairing tips**:
   - Use **FRESH CR2032 batteries** (this is the #1 cause of pairing failures)
   - Press and hold reset button for at least 5 seconds until LED blinks rapidly
   - Keep device within 30cm of Homey during entire pairing process
   - Wait 30-60 seconds - some devices take longer

**Motion Sensor**

The v2.15.71+ includes a critical IAS Zone enrollment fix that should resolve motion sensor pairing issues.

**If possible, please provide**:
1. Your current app version
2. Device model numbers or AliExpress item numbers
3. A diagnostic report from Homey (Settings â†’ System â†’ Create diagnostic report)

This will help me add your specific device IDs if they're not yet in the database.

Best regards,
Dylan

### For Peter - Diagnostic Analysis Response

**Post this**:

```
Hi @Peter_van_Werkhoven,

Thank you for the diagnostic code. I'll analyze it to identify the specific issue.

**Regarding the black square icon**:
This is a known rendering issue that's been fixed in v2.15.72. The fix includes:
- Proper SVG icon rendering
- Correct image path resolution
- Enhanced visual quality

**Next steps**:
1. Update to v2.15.72 when available (releasing very soon)
2. If the icon issue persists after update, try:
   - Remove the device
   - Restart Homey
   - Re-add the device

I'll review your diagnostic code (b93c400b-1a12-4907-bc25-7594eee36f80) and follow up with specific findings.

Thanks for your patience!
Dylan

## Key Messages to Emphasize

### Battery Freshness
> "Fresh batteries are CRITICAL. Even batteries that seem new may not have enough voltage for reliable Zigbee pairing. This is the #1 cause of pairing failures with battery-powered devices."

### Patience During Pairing
> "Some Tuya devices take 30-60 seconds to fully pair. The blue blinking LED is normal - it means the device is searching. Stay close to Homey and wait."

### Driver Visibility
> "Driver names are user-friendly in v2.15.55+. If you can't find a driver, ensure you're on the latest version (v2.15.72+)."

### Diagnostic Importance
> "Diagnostic reports help us identify your exact device manufacturer IDs so we can add support if needed. Your feedback makes the app better for everyone!"
