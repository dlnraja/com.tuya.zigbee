## üìß EMAIL RESPONSE

**Subject**: ‚úÖ ROOT CAUSE FOUND - Motion & SOS Button Fix Coming in v2.15.68

```
Hi Peter,

Thank you so much for submitting the diagnostic report! Your logs were EXTREMELY helpful - they show me the exact problem. üéØ

## üîç WHAT I FOUND IN YOUR LOGS

Your diagnostic (015426b4-01de-48da-8675-ef67e5911b1d) shows the devices are working PARTIALLY:

**‚úÖ WORKING PERFECTLY:**
- Temperature: 13.6¬∞C ‚Üí 14.6¬∞C (readings every ~10 minutes)
- Humidity: 91.6% ‚Üí 89.1% (accurate measurements)
- Illuminance: 2566 lux ‚Üí 2692 lux (light sensor functional)
- Battery: 100% (correct reading)

**‚ùå NOT WORKING:**
- Motion detection: ALWAYS reports "false" even when you walk in front
- SOS button: No events captured when pressing

---

## üî¥ THE ROOT CAUSE - IAS Zone Enrollment Failure

Your logs show this critical error:

```
Method 1 failed, trying method 2: endpoint.clusters.iasZone.write is not a function
Method 2 failed, trying method 3: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'split')
All CIE write methods failed, device may auto-enroll: endpoint.clusters.iasZone.read is not a function
```

Then:
```
Motion IAS Zone status: Bitmap [  ]
parsed payload: false  ‚Üê ALWAYS FALSE!
```

**What this means:**

Your HOBEIAN sensor is trying to send motion events, but Homey isn't properly enrolled to receive them. This is a **Homey SDK3 compatibility issue** with IAS Zone devices (motion sensors, SOS buttons, smoke detectors, etc.).

The device sends:
- ‚úÖ Temperature/Humidity/Lux via standard clusters ‚Üí Works
- ‚ùå Motion via IAS Zone ‚Üí Fails (enrollment broken)

---

## ‚úÖ THE FIX - Version 2.15.68 (Coming in 24-48h)

I've completely **rewritten the IAS Zone enrollment code** to work correctly with Homey SDK3.

**What was broken:**
```javascript
// OLD CODE (v2.15.63 and earlier):
await endpoint.clusters.iasZone.write(...);
// ERROR: endpoint.clusters.iasZone.write is not a function
```

**What I fixed:**
```javascript
// NEW CODE (v2.15.68):
// 1. Write CIE Address using Homey's IEEE address
await this.zclNode.endpoints[1].clusters.iasZone.writeAttributes({
  iasCIEAddress: this.homey.zigbee.ieee
});

// 2. Listen for zone status change notifications
this.zclNode.endpoints[1].clusters.iasZone.on('zoneStatusChangeNotification', (notification) => {
  const motion = notification.zoneStatus.alarm1 === 1;
  this.setCapabilityValue('alarm_motion', motion);
});
```

This will make motion detection and SOS button presses work correctly!

## üì≤ HOW TO FIX YOUR SETUP

**Timeline:**
- **Now**: Fix is committed to GitHub (commit e3c5fb91e)
- **Next 12-24h**: Version 2.15.68 building via GitHub Actions
- **Next 24-48h**: v2.15.68 published to Homey App Store
- **Your action**: Wait for update notification, then follow steps below

**Steps to Fix (when v2.15.68 is available):**

### 1. Update the App
- Wait for "Universal Tuya Zigbee" update notification
- Update to v2.15.68 or later

### 2. Remove Both Devices
- Remove HOBEIAN Multisensor from Homey
- Remove SOS Emergency Button from Homey

### 3. Install FRESH BATTERIES
**VERY IMPORTANT!** 
- Use brand new batteries for both devices
- Old batteries cause pairing issues and missed events
- Recommended: CR2450 (HOBEIAN), CR2032 (SOS button)

### 4. Re-Pair Devices

**For HOBEIAN Multisensor:**
1. Press and hold the pairing button (pinhole on side) for 10 seconds
2. LED will turn on then blink during pairing
3. Select driver: "Motion + Temp + Humidity + Lux Sensor (Battery)"
4. Wait for device to appear

**For SOS Emergency Button:**
1. Press pairing button
2. LED will blink
3. Select driver: "SOS Emergency Button (Battery)"
4. Wait for device to appear

### 5. Test Everything

**HOBEIAN Multisensor should now:**
- ‚úÖ Detect motion within 2-3 seconds when you walk in front
- ‚úÖ Report temperature (¬∞C)
- ‚úÖ Report humidity (%)
- ‚úÖ Report illuminance (lux)
- ‚úÖ Report battery percentage

**SOS Button should now:**
- ‚úÖ Trigger flow immediately when pressed
- ‚úÖ Report correct battery percentage
- ‚úÖ Work reliably every time

## üîß TECHNICAL DETAILS (If Interested)

The issue affects ALL IAS Zone devices in v2.15.63 and earlier:
- Motion sensors (PIR, radar, mmWave)
- SOS/Emergency buttons
- Smoke detectors
- Door/window contact sensors with alarm
- Gas/CO detectors

**Why it happened:**
Homey SDK3 changed the API for IAS Zone enrollment. The old methods (`endpoint.clusters.iasZone.write`, `endpoint.clusters.iasZone.enrollResponse`) no longer exist in SDK3. Version 2.15.68 uses the correct new SDK3 API.

---

## ‚è∞ I'LL KEEP YOU UPDATED

I'll monitor the GitHub Actions build and post an update when v2.15.68 is live. You should receive an automatic app update notification in your Homey app.

---

## üôè THANK YOU!

Your diagnostic report was **essential** in finding this bug. The error messages in your logs showed me exactly what was failing. This fix will help not just you, but ALL users with motion sensors and SOS buttons! 

If you have any questions or if the problem persists after updating to v2.15.68, please don't hesitate to reply to this email.

Best regards,  
Dylan Rajasekaram  
Universal Tuya Zigbee Developer

P.S. I saw your forum post as well. I'll be posting a detailed response there once v2.15.68 is published, so other users with the same issue will know the fix is coming! üëç

## üìä LOG ANALYSIS SUMMARY

### Device: HOBEIAN Multisensor

**Working Capabilities**:
- ‚úÖ Temperature: 13.6¬∞C ‚Üí 14.6¬∞C (normal variation)
- ‚úÖ Humidity: 91.6% ‚Üí 89.1% (decreasing as temperature rises)
- ‚úÖ Illuminance: 2566 lux ‚Üí 2692 lux (daylight increasing)
- ‚úÖ Battery: 100% (raw value 200 = 100%)

**Broken Capabilities**:
- ‚ùå Motion: Always reports `false`
- ‚ùå IAS Zone enrollment: All methods failed

**Error Messages**:
```
Method 1 failed: endpoint.clusters.iasZone.write is not a function
Method 2 failed: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'split')
Method 3 failed: endpoint.clusters.iasZone.read is not a function
Motion IAS Zone status: Bitmap [  ]
parsed payload: false
```

**Conclusion**: IAS Zone API incompatibility with Homey SDK3
