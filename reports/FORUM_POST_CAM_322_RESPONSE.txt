Hi @Cam,

Thank you for the detailed report! I've investigated both devices and have some good news and troubleshooting steps:

**1-Button Wireless Scene Switch (Battery)**

✅ Good news: This driver DOES exist in the app with exactly that name!

The issue might be:
1. **App version** - Please verify you're on v2.15.72 (latest version)
   - Check: Homey app → Settings → Apps → Universal Tuya Zigbee

2. **Fresh batteries** - This is critical! Old/weak batteries are the #1 cause of pairing failures
   - Use brand new CR2032 batteries

3. **Pairing procedure**:
   - Press and hold the reset button for 3 seconds until LED blinks rapidly
   - In Homey: Add Device → Universal Tuya Zigbee → "1-Button Wireless Scene Switch (Battery)"
   - Keep device within 30cm of Homey during pairing

**Motion Sensor**

The `motion_temp_humidity_illumination_multi_battery` driver should work for multi-function sensors.

Troubleshooting:
1. **Replace batteries** - Most important step!
2. **Reset properly** - Press pairing button until LED blinks rapidly (5-10 seconds)
3. **Stay very close** - Within 30cm of Homey during entire pairing
4. **Be patient** - Some sensors take 30-60 seconds to fully pair
5. **Blue blinking LED** is normal - it means the device is searching

**Next Steps**

If the above doesn't work, I'll need some info to help further:

1. What's your current app version?
2. Do you have the AliExpress item number or device model?
3. Can you share a screenshot of the Zigbee logs during pairing? (Settings → Zigbee)

The key issue I've seen in similar cases is usually:
- Weak batteries (even if they seem new)
- Not holding reset button long enough
- Device too far from Homey during pairing

Let me know how it goes, and I'm here to help get these working!

Best regards,
Dylan
