Hi @Cam,

Let me provide more detailed troubleshooting steps to help get your devices working:

**1-Button Wireless Scene Switch (Battery)**

The driver DOES exist in the app - it's called "1-Button Wireless Scene Switch (Battery)" (driver ID: wireless_switch_1gang_cr2032). If you can't see it in the pairing list, here's what to check:

1. **Verify your app version**:
   - Open Homey app → Settings → Apps → Universal Tuya Zigbee
   - Current version should be 2.15.72 (just released)
   - If you're on an older version, update first

2. **Critical pairing requirements**:
   - **FRESH CR2032 batteries** - This is absolutely critical! Even batteries that seem new may not have enough voltage for reliable Zigbee pairing. Weak batteries are the #1 cause of pairing failures.
   - Press and hold the reset button for at least 5 seconds until LED blinks rapidly
   - Keep the device within 30cm (1 foot) of Homey during the entire pairing process
   - Be patient - some devices take 30-60 seconds to fully pair

3. **Pairing steps**:
   - In Homey app: Add Device → Universal Tuya Zigbee
   - Look for "1-Button Wireless Scene Switch (Battery)"
   - Follow the pairing instructions
   - The blue blinking LED is normal - it means the device is searching

**Motion Sensor (motion_temp_humidity_illumination_multi_battery)**

Good news! Version 2.15.71+ includes a critical IAS Zone enrollment fix that resolves motion sensor pairing issues. The fix:
- Completely rewrote IAS Zone enrollment using correct Homey SDK3 API
- Fixed writeAttributes method for iasCIEAddress
- Motion sensors and SOS buttons now work properly

**Troubleshooting steps**:
1. Update to v2.15.72
2. Use fresh AAA or CR2032 batteries (check your sensor's battery type)
3. Reset the sensor: Press pairing button for 10 seconds until LED blinks rapidly
4. Stay very close to Homey during pairing
5. Wait patiently - up to 60 seconds for full pairing

**If the above doesn't work**:

Could you please provide:
1. Your current app version number
2. Device model numbers or AliExpress item numbers (if available)
3. A diagnostic report from Homey:
   - Settings → System → Create diagnostic report
   - Share the diagnostic code here

This will help me identify your exact device manufacturer IDs and add them to the drivers if they're not yet in the database.

**What to expect from v2.15.72**:
✅ IAS Zone enrollment completely fixed
✅ Motion sensors and SOS buttons work properly
✅ Icon rendering improvements
✅ Enhanced pairing reliability

Your feedback helps improve the app for the entire community. Thanks for your patience, and I'm here to help get these devices working!

Best regards,
Dylan
