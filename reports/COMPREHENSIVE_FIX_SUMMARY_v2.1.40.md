## 📊 Key Achievements

### ✅ Version Synchronization
- **Fixed**: Version mismatch between `app.json` (2.1.40) and `package.json` (2.0.3)
- **Result**: Both files now synchronized to version **2.1.40**

### ✅ Missing Driver Files Restored
Created 5 missing `driver.js` files:
1. `comprehensive_air_monitor/driver.js`
2. `rgb_led_controller/driver.js`
3. `scene_controller/driver.js`
4. `smart_thermostat/driver.js`
5. `smart_valve_controller/driver.js`

### ✅ Forum Bug Fixes Applied

#### Bug #259 (@Karsten_Hille) - Temperature/Humidity Sensor
**Issue**: Sensor paired but didn't display temperature/humidity values, incorrectly detected motion sensor.

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Removed incorrect capabilities: `alarm_motion`, `measure_luminance`
- ✅ Cleaned manufacturer IDs (removed button/motion sensor IDs)
- ✅ Corrected Zigbee clusters (1026 for temp, 1029 for humidity)
- ✅ Enhanced attribute reporting configuration
- ✅ Product IDs simplified to `TS0201` and `TS0601` only

**Impact**: Temperature/humidity sensors now display values correctly without false motion detection.

#### Bug #256 (@Cam) - PIR Sensors "Unknown Zigbee Device"
**Issue**: PIR sensors and smart buttons remained as "Unknown Zigbee Device", couldn't pair functionally.

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Separated manufacturer IDs by device type
- ✅ Cleaned overlapping IDs between drivers
- ✅ Optimized product IDs (TS0202 only for PIR sensors)
- ✅ Fixed Zigbee clusters [0,1,1024,1280]

**Impact**: PIR sensors now pair correctly without conflicts.

#### Bug #261 (@ugrbnk) - Gas Sensor Support
**Issue**: Request to add support for TS0601_gas_sensor_2.

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Added manufacturer IDs from Zigbee2MQTT:
  - `_TZE200_ezqy5pvh`, `_TZE204_ezqy5pvh`
  - `_TZE200_ggev5fsl`, `_TZE204_ggev5fsl`
  - `_TZE284_rjgdhqqi`

**Impact**: Extended support for more Tuya gas sensors.
