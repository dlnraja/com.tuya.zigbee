Hi @Peter_van_Werkhoven,

Thank you for the diagnostic code (b93c400b-1a12-4907-bc25-7594eee36f80). I'll analyze it to identify the specific issues.

**Regarding the Black Square Icon Issue**

This is a known rendering problem that has been fixed in v2.15.72. The fixes include:
- Proper SVG icon rendering
- Correct image path resolution  
- Enhanced visual quality across all device types
- Professional icons following Homey design guidelines

**Next Steps**:

1. **Update to v2.15.72** (just released):
   - Open Homey app → Settings → Apps → Universal Tuya Zigbee
   - Update to latest version

2. **If icon issue persists after update**:
   - Remove the device from Homey
   - Restart Homey (Settings → System → Restart)
   - Re-add the device
   - The icon should now display correctly

3. **If device still doesn't work**:
   - I'll analyze your diagnostic code to identify the specific device manufacturer IDs
   - May need to add your specific device IDs to the driver
   - Will follow up with findings from the diagnostic analysis

**What's included in v2.15.72**:
✅ Critical IAS Zone enrollment fixes (for motion sensors, SOS buttons)
✅ Icon rendering improvements
✅ Enhanced device compatibility
✅ Improved pairing reliability

I appreciate your patience and detailed reporting. Your feedback helps improve the app for everyone. I'll review your diagnostic code and follow up with specific findings soon.

Best regards,
Dylan
