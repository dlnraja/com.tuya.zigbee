fix: Critical cascade errors - 11 drivers not reading Zigbee values

PROBLEM SOLVED:
- Temperature, battery, humidity, luminance values showing "N/A"
- 11 drivers had empty device.js files (comments but no actual code)
- ~30-40 devices affected across multiple GitHub issues and forum posts

CORRECTIONS APPLIED:
✅ Fixed 11 drivers with complete Zigbee capability registration
✅ Added proper parsers for temperature (/100), battery (/2), luminance (log)
✅ Configured automatic attribute reporting
✅ Added zclNode parameter to super.onNodeInit()
✅ Range validation for battery (0-100%)

DRIVERS FIXED:
1. temperature_humidity_sensor (5 capabilities)
2. vibration_sensor (5 capabilities)  
3. motion_temp_humidity_illumination_sensor (5 capabilities)
4. temperature_sensor (5 capabilities)
5. temperature_sensor_advanced (5 capabilities)
6. door_window_sensor (6 capabilities)
7. water_leak_sensor (6 capabilities)
8. pir_radar_illumination_sensor (3 capabilities)
9. co2_temp_humidity (4 capabilities)
10. air_quality_monitor (1 capability)
11. air_quality_monitor_pro (3 capabilities)

TECHNICAL CHANGES:
- Added registerCapability() for all missing capabilities
- Implemented reportParser and getParser functions
- Configured configureAttributeReporting() for battery
- Proper cluster mappings (1026, 1029, 1, 1024, 1280, 1037)
- Error handling with try/catch blocks

VALIDATION:
✅ homey app validate - PASSED (level: publish)
✅ All capabilities properly registered
✅ Parsers tested and validated
✅ Zero validation errors

IMPACT:
- +672 lines of functional code
- 47 capabilities now properly registered
- Issues #26, #28, #29, #31, #32 resolved
- Forum reports addressed

FILES CHANGED:
- 11 drivers/*/device.js files (complete rewrite)
- FIX_DEVICE_CAPABILITIES_CASCADE.js (new automation script)
- REPONSE_PROBLEMES_LECTURE_VALEURS.md (user documentation)
- RAPPORT_CASCADE_FIXES.md (technical report)
- REPONSE_FORUM_HOMEY.md (updated with fix section)

VERSION: 2.1.31
