## 🔑 Key Talking Points

### Fresh Batteries (Critical!)
> "FRESH CR2032 batteries - This is absolutely critical! Even batteries that seem new may not have enough voltage for reliable Zigbee pairing. Weak batteries are the #1 cause of pairing failures."

### IAS Zone Fix
> "Version 2.15.71+ includes a critical IAS Zone enrollment fix that resolves motion sensor pairing issues. The fix completely rewrote IAS Zone enrollment using correct Homey SDK3 API."

### Patience
> "Be patient - some devices take 30-60 seconds to fully pair. The blue blinking LED is normal - it means the device is searching."

### Community Value
> "Your feedback helps improve the app for the entire community. Thanks for your patience!"
