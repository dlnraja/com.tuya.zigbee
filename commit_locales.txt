fix: Generate complete locales for visual improvements

PROBLEM: User reported no visual improvements in Homey
ROOT CAUSE: locales/fr.json only 25 lines, missing all capability translations

SOLUTION:
- Generated complete en.json and fr.json
- Added 40+ capability translations
- Added 10+ settings translations
- Added common UI strings

IMPACT: All capabilities now have proper French labels and units
