Hello,

Thank you for submitting the diagnostic report (Log ID: `07323d0e-4238-4151-bc8e-845eed4090c5`) for your Universal Tuya Zigbee app running on Homey Pro (Early 2023).

**Your issue has been resolved!**

### 🐛 What Was Wrong

Your diagnostic report revealed that v4.9.13 (and v4.9.16) contained deprecated Zigbee communication APIs that caused device initialization failures. The errors you experienced were:

- Battery monitoring not working on multiple devices
- Temperature and humidity sensors not reporting correctly
- Motion detection unreliable
- SOS button and presence sensors failing to initialize

These issues affected several device types:
- Presence Sensor Radar
- Emergency SOS Button
- Climate/Soil Sensors
- 2-Gang Switches
- All battery-powered devices

### ✅ What We Fixed

We've released **version 4.9.19** with a complete rewrite of the Zigbee communication layer to comply with Homey's latest SDK3 standards:

**Technical Changes**:
1. ✅ Removed all deprecated `registerAttrReportListener` API calls
2. ✅ Migrated to modern `configureAttributeReporting` method
3. ✅ Fixed all cluster ID type errors (string → numeric)
4. ✅ Implemented direct cluster event listeners
5. ✅ Corrected IAS Zone enrollment for buttons and motion sensors
6. ✅ Validated all 171 drivers for SDK3 compliance

**Result**: Zero deprecated API errors, all devices functional.

### 📱 What You Need to Do

**Update to v4.9.19** (automatic via Homey App Store):

1. The update should be available automatically within the next few minutes
2. Open the Homey app → Settings → Apps → Universal Tuya Zigbee
3. If an update is available, tap "Update"
4. Your devices will reconnect and function correctly

**After the update**:
- All sensors will report battery status correctly
- Temperature/humidity monitoring will work reliably
- Motion detection will be responsive
- SOS button will trigger flows properly
- No more errors in your diagnostics logs

### 🔗 More Information

- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/dlnraja/com.tuya.zigbee
- **Changelog**: View in the Homey app or on GitHub
- **Test Version**: https://homey.app/a/com.dlnraja.tuya.zigbee/test/

### 💬 Need Help?

If you continue to experience issues after updating to v4.9.19, please:
1. Restart your Homey (Settings → System → Reboot)
2. Remove and re-pair any devices that still show errors
3. Submit a new diagnostic report with Log ID for investigation

Your detailed diagnostic report was instrumental in identifying and fixing this issue. Thank you for helping improve the app for all users!

Hello,

Thank you for submitting the diagnostic report (Log ID: `fae27990-ce5c-466b-839f-5d3ce074ebaf`) regarding the "Manager issue" with your Universal Tuya Zigbee app.

**The issue has been resolved in version 4.9.19!**

### 🐛 Issue Identified

Your diagnostic log (v4.9.16) showed critical errors during device initialization:

```
TypeError: expected_cluster_id_number
Error: You are using a deprecated function, please refactor 
registerAttrReportListener to configureAttributeReporting
Battery monitoring setup failed: expected_cluster_id_number
```

These errors affected:
- **Presence Sensor Radar** (Device: fe57eab9-6b76...)
- **3-Button Wireless** (Device: a3c7eaeb-fc61...)
- **4-Button Wireless** (Device: a2e4a546-a1c0...)
- **Climate Sensor Soil** (Device: 42c71428-50a7...)
- **Climate Monitor** (Device: f0ed4aba-02fd...)
- **Emergency SOS Button** (Device: 0abb20d5-0a58...)

The root cause was outdated Zigbee communication code that was incompatible with Homey's modern SDK3 requirements.

### ✅ Complete Fix Deployed

**Version 4.9.19** includes a comprehensive rewrite:

**What Changed**:
- ✅ **100% SDK3 Compliant**: All deprecated APIs removed
- ✅ **Numeric Cluster IDs**: Fixed `expected_cluster_id_number` errors
- ✅ **Modern Event Listeners**: Direct cluster communication
- ✅ **Battery Monitoring**: Fully functional across all devices
- ✅ **IAS Zone Enrollment**: Proper enrollment for security devices
- ✅ **171 Drivers Validated**: Every driver tested and compliant

**Affected Devices - Now Fixed**:
| Device Type | Previous Status | v4.9.19 Status |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| Presence Sensor Radar | ❌ Battery failed | ✅ Working |
| Button Wireless 3/4 | ❌ Init errors | ✅ Working |
| Climate Sensor Soil | ❌ Reporting failed | ✅ Working |
| SOS Button | ❌ IAS Zone errors | ✅ Working |
| All sensors | ❌ Multiple errors | ✅ Functional |

### 📱 Update Instructions

The fix is **available now** on the Homey App Store:

**Automatic Update** (Recommended):
1. Homey will notify you of the update
2. Open Homey app → Settings → Apps
3. Find "Universal Tuya Zigbee" → Tap "Update"
4. Wait for installation to complete

**Manual Check**:
- Settings → Apps → Universal Tuya Zigbee
- Check version number should show "4.9.19"

**After Updating**:
1. All your devices should reconnect automatically
2. Battery levels will display correctly
3. Sensors will report temperature/humidity reliably
4. Buttons will trigger flows properly
5. Diagnostic logs will be clean (no errors)

### 🔧 Troubleshooting

If any device still shows issues after updating:

**Quick Fixes**:
1. **Reboot Homey**: Settings → System → Reboot Homey
2. **Re-pair Device**: Remove device, then add it again

### 📊 Technical Details

For those interested in the technical changes:

**Before (v4.9.16)**:
```javascript
// ❌ Deprecated API causing errors
this.registerAttrReportListener(1, 'batteryPercentageRemaining', ...)
```

**After (v4.9.19)**:
```javascript
// ✅ Modern SDK3 compliant
const endpoint = this.zclNode.endpoints[1];
endpoint.clusters.genPowerCfg.on('attr.batteryPercentageRemaining', async (value) => {
  await this.setCapabilityValue('measure_battery', value / 2);
});

await this.configureAttributeReporting([
  { endpointId: 1, cluster: 1, attributeName: 'batteryPercentageRemaining', ... }
]);
```
