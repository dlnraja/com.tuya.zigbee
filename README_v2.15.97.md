# 🎯 Universal Tuya Zigbee v2.15.97 - Complete Project Overview

## 🚀 Latest Release: Critical IAS Zone Bug Fix

**Version:** 2.15.97  
**Released:** 2025-10-15  
**Status:** ✅ DEPLOYED TO GITHUB - Auto-publishing to Homey App Store  
**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL - Fixes non-functional motion sensors and SOS buttons

---

## 📋 What Was Fixed

### Critical Bug: IAS Zone Enrollment Failure

**Problem:**
- Motion sensors not detecting movement
- SOS emergency buttons not triggering flows
- Error: "v.replace is not a function"
- All IAS Zone devices affected

**Root Cause:**
IEEE address type mismatch - code assumed string but received Buffer, causing crashes during enrollment.

**Solution:**
Complete rewrite of IAS Zone enrollment with proper type validation:
```javascript
// ✅ Now handles both Buffer and string types safely
if (Buffer.isBuffer(ieeeBuffer) && ieeeBuffer.length === 8) {
  await endpoint.clusters.iasZone.writeAttributes({
    iasCIEAddress: ieeeBuffer
  });
}
```

## 📝 Usage Guide

### Adding Devices

1. **Open Homey App** → Devices → Add Device
2. **Select "Universal Tuya Zigbee"**
3. **Choose driver by function** (not brand):
   - Motion sensor
   - Door/window sensor
   - Smart plug
   - etc.
4. **Put device in pairing mode** (usually hold button 5-10s)
5. **Wait for Homey to discover**

### Troubleshooting

**Motion sensor not detecting:**
- Update to v2.15.97 (fixes IAS Zone bug)
- Re-pair device if still not working
- Check diagnostic logs for "✅ Enrollment verified"

**SOS button not triggering:**
- Update to v2.15.97 (fixes IAS Zone bug)
- Test by pressing button (should trigger alarm_generic)
- Verify flow cards are properly configured

**Device not pairing:**
- Reset device (see manufacturer instructions)
- Move closer to Homey during pairing
- Check if manufacturer ID is supported (send diagnostic report)

### Diagnostic Reports

To help fix issues:
1. **Homey App** → Settings → Apps → Universal Tuya Zigbee
2. **Send diagnostic report**
3. Add description of issue
4. Developer receives report and can investigate
