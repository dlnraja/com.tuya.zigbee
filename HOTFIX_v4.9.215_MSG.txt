v4.9.215 CRITICAL REGRESSION FIXES

FIXES 5 CRITICAL BUGS:
1. TuyaEF00Manager.detectAvailableMethods() - Method does not exist (removed call)
2. TuyaEF00Manager.on() - Not an EventEmitter (now extends EventEmitter)
3. TuyaEF00Manager events - Added emit() for dp-X events
4. ZigbeeTimeout.withTimeout() - Missing this. prefix (already fixed locally, forcing redeploy)
5. Climate sensor soil - DP listeners now working with EventEmitter

AFFECTED DEVICES:
- climate_sensor_soil (Tuya soil tester)
- presence_sensor_radar (all radar sensors)
- button_emergency_sos (SOS buttons)
- climate_monitor_temp_humidity (temp/humidity sensors)
- ALL devices using TuyaEF00Manager

All battery and sensor data now reporting correctly.
