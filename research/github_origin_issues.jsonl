Describe the bug\n\n> Le workflow `Automated Tuya Zigbee Contributions` √©choue syst√©matiquement √† l'√©tape `actions/checkout@v4` avec l'erreur : `Error: Input required and not supplied: token`.\n\nCe probl√®me persiste malgr√© les tentatives de correction suivantes :\n1.  Ajout de la section `permissions` avec les droits `contents: write` et `pull-requests: write` dans le fichier `automation.yml`.\n2.  Configuration des param√®tres du d√©p√¥t (`Settings > Actions > General`) pour accorder les permissions de \"Lecture et √©criture\" aux workflows.\n\n### To Reproduce\n\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n\n1. Aller √† l'onglet 'Actions'.\n2. S√©lectionner le workflow 'Automated Tuya Zigbee Contributions'.\n3. Lancer le workflow manuellement via 'Run workflow'.\n4. Observer l'√©chec √† l'√©tape 'Run actions/checkout@v4'.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n> Le workflow devrait s'ex√©cuter avec succ√®s, en particulier l'√©tape de `checkout`, car les permissions ont √©t√© configur√©es.\n\n### App and Homey version\n\n> * What Homey version are you running?\n> * What version of Homey firmware do you use?\n> * What version of the Tuya Zigbee App are you using?\n\n### Screenshots\n\n> L'erreur est visible dans les logs du workflow : `Error: Input required and not supplied: token`\n\n### Additional context\n\n> **Hypoth√®se :** L'erreur est tr√®s probablement due aux restrictions de s√©curit√© que GitHub impose aux workflows s'ex√©cutant sur des d√©p√¥ts clon√©s (forks). Par d√©faut, le `GITHUB_TOKEN` a des permissions restreintes en lecture seule, ce qui n√©cessite une approbation manuelle pour √©lever les privil√®ges.\n> \n> **Contexte de la session :**\n> - **Utilisateur :** dlnraja\n> - **Date de l'erreur :** 2025-07-20 15:54:29 UTC\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dlnraja/com.tuya.zigbee/issues/2/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dlnraja/com.tuya.zigbee/issues/2/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dlnraja/com.tuya.zigbee/issues/1","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dlnraja/com.tuya.zigbee","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dlnraja/com.tuya.zigbee/issues/1/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dlnraja/com.tuya.zigbee/issues/1/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dlnraja/com.tuya.zigbee/issues/1/events","html_url":"https://github.com/dlnraja/com.tuya.zigbee/issues/1","id":3246454144,"node_id":"I_kwDOPPue0s7BgPWA","number":1,"title":"Bug: √âchec de l'automatisation √† cause d'un historique Git conflictuel insoluble","user":{"login":"dlnraja","id":9746898,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3NDY4OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9746898?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlnraja","html_url":"https://github.com/dlnraja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlnraja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlnraja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlnraja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlnraja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlnraja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlnraja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlnraja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlnraja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlnraja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":8974385523,"node_id":"LA_kwDOPPue0s8AAAACFupBcw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dlnraja/com.tuya.zigbee/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"d73a4a","default":true,"description":"Something isn't working"}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2025-07-20T15:28:55Z","updated_at":"2025-07-20T15:28:55Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"OWNER","active_lock_reason":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"body":"### Describe the bug\nL'automatisation des contributions sur le fork `dlnraja/com.tuya.zigbee` √©choue syst√©matiquement √† cause d'un historique Git conflictuel. Les tentatives de synchronisation, de nettoyage de branche, ou de push forc√© se soldent par des erreurs persistantes, rendant le workflow inop√©rant. Le probl√®me est si profond√©ment ancr√© que seule une r√©initialisation compl√®te du d√©p√¥t (suppression et nouveau fork) a permis de le contourner.\n\n### To Reproduce\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. Utiliser le fork initial de `dlnraja/com.tuya.zigbee`.\n2. Tenter de mettre en place un script (PowerShell ou via GitHub Actions) pour synchroniser la branche avec `upstream/master`.\n3. Essayer de r√©soudre les conflits ou de forcer un push.\n4. Constater les erreurs telles que `! [remote rejected]` ou des √©checs de rebase infinis.\n\n### Expected behavior\nLe workflow d'automatisation devrait pouvoir se synchroniser avec le d√©p√¥t `upstream`, appliquer les modifications de code et de documentation, et pousser les commits vers le fork `origin` sans √™tre bloqu√© par des conflits historiques insolubles.\n\n### Screenshots\nLes logs des terminaux PowerShell partag√©s dans la conversation illustrent les diff√©rentes erreurs rencontr√©es.\n\n### Additional context\nLe probl√®me a √©t√© r√©solu en supprimant compl√®tement le fork `dlnraja/com.tuya.zigbee` et en en cr√©ant un nouveau, vierge de tout historique conflictuel. La nouvelle configuration, bas√©e sur ce d√©p√¥t propre, est maintenant fonctionnelle.
