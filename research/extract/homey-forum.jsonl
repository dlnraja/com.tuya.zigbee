   This app makes Homey support Tuya Zigbee devices!  \n Tuya Zigbee devices are white label products and found with many brands, each brand will have a unique manufacturerName ID and this will have to be added to the app. \n Live version:  Tuya Zigbee App for Homey | Homey  \nTest version:  Tuya Zigbee | Homey  \n \n Thanks for all the interest in the app, I’m very thankfull for all the help and support! \n If you are unable to help maintain and develop the app and want to support me in any other way I’m happy for any and all  donations via Paypal  !   \n \n   PROCESS FOR REPORTING AN ISSUE WITH THE APP   \nIf/When you find issues please create a crash report from the app and add your name to it and give me a notice on Github, here or in PM. \n \n   PROCESS FOR REQUESTING DEVICES TO BE ADDED   \nIf your device is not supported by the app it will have to be added by adding code to the app, this is done by me or by someone helping me out (anyone can - it’s open source   ). \n  To be able to add more devices I will need help with interviews of the devices you want added. Anyone asking for a device to be added will have to have:  \n \n upgraded to firmware v5 \n have a physical example of the device \n add it as a generic Zigbee device \n go to  https://developer.athom.com/tools/zigbee   and interview the device \n copy the info (by clicking the copy button/icon!) and post it as a  new issue  at the apps Github repository(</>). \n \n Github:  GitHub - JohanBendz/com.tuya.zigbee  \n \n I request that all device requests be directed to Github. The reason is straightforward: previously, when requests were made in this thread, I had to manually create an issue on Github, transfer the information, fill in any missing details, and then schedule the device to be added. Additionally, many requests were either duplicates or inquiries about the status of an existing request. \n I hope that creating a Github account (which is free and straightforward) isn’t too much to ask. Doing so will significantly streamline my process for handling requests and follow-ups. I believe this approach will also encourage more individuals to contribute code. \n Old requests made in this thread can be found here: \n https://community.homey.app/t/app-pro-tuya-zigbee-app-device-request-archive/  \n You are, and will always be, more than welcome to discuss the app, report problems, seek support, share ideas, and more in this thread. All I ask is that device requests be made on  Github . \n \n TVO = This Device is only supported by the Test version of the app. (Test Version Only) \n  SUPPORTED DEVICES:  \n  Sensors  \n  Temperature and Humidity Sensor   \n \n TUYATEC-g3gl6cgy / RH3052 \n TUYATEC-Bfq2i2Sy / RH3052 \n TUYATEC-abkehqus / RH3052 \n TUYATEC-yg5dcbfu / RH3052 \n TUYATEC-prhs1rsd / RH3052 \n TUYATEC-gqhxixyk / RH3052 \n TUYATEC-vmgh3fxd / RH3052 (TVO) \n TUYATEC-ojmxeikg / RH3052 (TVO) \n TUYATEC-1g3tawnp / RH3052 (TVO) \n _TZ3000_i8jfiezr / TS0201 (TVO) \n TUYATEC-v3uxbuxy / RH3052 (TVO) \n _TZ3000_bguser20 / TS0201 (TVO) \n _TZ3000_dowj6gyi / TS0201 (TVO) \n _TZ3000_fllyghyj / TS0201 (TVO) \n _TZ3000_8ybe88nf / TS0201 (TVO) \n _TZ3000_fie1dpkm / TS0201 (TVO) \n _TZ3000_0s1izerx / TS0201 (TVO) \n TUYATEC-ojmxeikq / RH3052 (TVO) \n TUYATEC-riuj5xzs / RH3052 (TVO) \n _TZ3000_xr3htd96 / TS0201 (Tenky)(TVO) \n _TZ3000_saiqcn0y / TS0201 (TVO) \n TUYATEC-1uxx9cci / RH3052 (TVO) \n _TZE200_a8sdabtg / TS0601 (TVO) \n _TZ3000_utwgoauk / TS0601 (TVO) \n _TZE200_9yapgbuv / TS0601 (TVO) \n _TZ3000_f2bw0b6k / TS0201 (TVO) \n _TZ3000_zl1kmjqx / TS0201 (TVO) \n TUYATEC-HaoiuWzy / RH3052 (TVO) \n TUYATEC-qun7vq14 / RH3052 (TVO) \n _TZE200_yjjdcqsq / TS0601 (TVO) \n _TZE200_utkemkbs / TS0601 (TVO) \n _TZ3000_6uzkisv2 / TS0601 (TVO) \n \n   LCD Temperature and Humidity Sensor   \n \n _TZ2000_a476raq2 / TS0201 \n _TZ2000_xogb73am / TS0201 \n _TZ2000_avdnvykf / TS0201 \n _TZ2000_hjsgdkfl / TS0201 \n _TYZB01_a476raq2 / TS0201 \n _TYZB01_hjsgdkfl / TS0201 \n _TYZB01_iuepbmpv / TS0201 \n _TZ3000_rusu2vzb / TS0201 (TVO) \n _TYZB01_cbiezpds / SM0201 (T"}

Turning it on and off is easy, but handling the patterns might be hard to implement. It looks like the devices from  Twinkly App for Homey | Homey  but I guess the Lidl app does not let you scan the Christmas tree like Twinkly does. Is there like 12 patterns or what does it look like? What would be a good start? \n No, if you are unable to add a device to Homey it’s not the app that is the problem. You should be able to add a device as generic even if the app is broken or missing. So… pairing issues is always a Homey issue and I urge anyone with this problem to call/mail Athom Support or turn to threads about connection issues. \n Yes, I aim to release the app as open source. There are however a few things I want to be done with first so the app is not spinning in all directions. (adding Tuya Specific Cluster Support and make app structure clean and nice to work with etc). \n There is now a (short) list of known issues that I am working on and I am super happy for the feedback, help and support I get from you all. Keep up the great work!   "}

Reason is that all apps from a verified developer will have the verified label, even apps that are not approved for the cloud/bridge, and for developers like me who has a number of apps that will only be available on the Pro platform this could be misleading. \n I understand and accept Athom’s decision and will at some point soon transfer this app to a new account but it will still be me managing it. Your installations and future upgrades will not be affected by this change. \n Before doing so I will release an update of the app, without support for the cloud/bridge. It includes more than 50 added device id’s. \n I am well aware of the many requests and the interest in more frequent updates and while I share the passion for the app time has been limited.
