feat(diagnostic): v4.9.60 - FINAL defensive logs everywhere

CRITICAL: v4.9.59 did NOT have diagnostic logs!
This version RE-ADDS all defensive logging.

DEFENSIVE LOGS EVERYWHERE:
‚úÖ console.log() at EVERY critical step
‚úÖ Try-catch around ALL operations
‚úÖ Safe data checks (if exists before use)
‚úÖ Skip if no data (no errors)
‚úÖ Emojis for visual identification

LOGS PATTERN:
üö® [DEVICE START] - First line (ALWAYS visible)
üîç [IDENTITY] - Identity check
‚úÖ [INIT] - Defaults set
‚ö° [AVAILABILITY] - setAvailable
üîÑ [BACKGROUND] - Background init
‚úÖ [COMPLETE] - onNodeInit done

PURPOSE:
Determine if devices initialize at all
If console.log appears ‚Üí devices init, RC logging broken
If no console.log ‚Üí onNodeInit never called

USER REPORT:
"Diag encore une fois pas d'am√©lioration"
- v4.9.59 had NO logs (correct - didn't have them)
- Devices reportedly work but don't log
- Homey v12.9.0-rc.5 (Release Candidate)

NEXT DIAGNOSTIC SHOULD SHOW:
Either console.log markers OR nothing
This will confirm root cause

FILES:
- app.json: v4.9.60
- lib/BaseHybridDevice.js: All defensive logs re-added
