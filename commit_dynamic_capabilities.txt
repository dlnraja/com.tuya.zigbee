feat: Add Dynamic Capability Manager for auto-discovery

PROBLEM: Multi-endpoint devices show only 1 button/socket
ROOT CAUSE: Capabilities created statically, not per endpoint

SOLUTION - Dynamic Capability Manager:
- Auto-inspects all endpoints and clusters at init
- Creates capabilities dynamically for each endpoint
- Maps cluster ID to Homey capability automatically
- Adds endpoint suffix for multi-endpoint (onoff.2, onoff.3)
- Sets up listeners and binds for each capability
- Reads initial values to populate Homey UI
- Generates proper titles with endpoint numbers

IMPACT:
- USB 2-gang switch now shows 2 buttons
- 4-button remotes show all 4 buttons
- All metrics (temperature, humidity, battery) now populate
- Flow cards created for all endpoints
- Binds only called if cluster.bind exists (fixes crashes)

FIXES:
- Multi-endpoint visibility
- Missing capabilities
- Empty values in Homey UI
- Incomplete flow cards
- cluster.bind crashes
