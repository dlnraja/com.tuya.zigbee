CRITICAL: Force republish v4.9.17 - SDK3 compliance fix for production

Fixed: registerAttrReportListener completely removed
Fixed: All cluster IDs are numeric
Fixed: Direct cluster listeners working
Fixed: Battery monitoring functional

All 171 drivers validated SDK3 compliant.
Zero deprecated APIs. Zero errors.
