Hi everyone! üëã

Exciting updates coming to Universal TUYA Zigbee! I've been working hard on several major improvements based on community feedback and forum diagnostics.

## üéØ What's New in v4.0.6

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Motion Aware - Passive Presence Detection (INNOVATION!)**

I'm thrilled to introduce **Motion Aware** - a groundbreaking feature inspired by Philips Hue technology that lets your Zigbee bulbs act as **passive presence detectors**!

**How it works:**
- Uses existing Zigbee bulbs (no extra hardware needed!)
- Monitors RSSI/LQI signal strength changes
- Detects human presence by analyzing signal perturbations
- Zero additional cost if you already have compatible bulbs

**Compatible Drivers (16 bulbs):**
- LSC bulbs (3 models)
- INNR bulbs (3 models)
- MOES bulbs (4 models)
- OSRAM bulbs (3 models)
- Philips bulbs (3 models)

**New Flow Cards:**
- "Presence detected (Motion Aware)" - with RSSI & deviation tokens
- "Presence cleared (Motion Aware)"

**Settings:**
- Sensitivity: Low / Medium / High
- Configurable timeout
- Auto-calibration

**Status:** Phase 1 complete (R&D, documentation, code implemented)  
**Coming:** Beta testing in next release
