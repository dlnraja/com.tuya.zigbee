fix: Homey publish workflow - Add pull rebase and retry logic

Fixed workflow "Homey App - Official Publish" failing with push rejected errors.

Issue:
- update-docs job failed with push rejected
- version job could fail with concurrent pushes
- Same race condition as update-docs.yml

Solution:
✅ Added git pull --rebase before push (2 locations)
✅ Implemented retry logic (3 attempts with 5s delay)
✅ Sync with remote changes automatically

Changes to .github/workflows/homey-official-publish.yml:

1. update-docs job (line 37-61):
   - Pull rebase before push
   - Retry loop if push fails
   - Auto-sync between retries

2. version job (line 130-151):
   - Pull rebase before push with tags
   - Retry loop for both push and tags
   - Handle concurrent version updates

Benefits:
- Handles concurrent workflow runs gracefully
- No more push rejected errors in publish workflow
- Automatic conflict resolution via rebase
- Resilient to timing issues
- Safe for multi-job workflow dependencies

Testing:
- Next publish workflow will use new logic
- Both jobs protected against race conditions
- Version bumps won't fail on concurrent pushes

Related:
- Same fix as update-docs.yml (commit 7ce4c6e00)
- Same fix as ci workflows (upload-artifact v4)

Version: 3.0.5
Status: All workflows fixed and resilient
