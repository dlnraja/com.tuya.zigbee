fix(CRITICAL): v4.9.66 - Fix USB 2-port mis-pairing as switch_basic_2gang

USER REPORT:
"non c'est un apapril avec 2 usb eouteur pas un switch_basic_2gang"
"il a sauté du réseau zigbee"

REAL DEVICE:
- AliExpress: USB 2-port outlet
- Product: TS0002  
- Manufacturer: _TZ3000_h1ipgkwn
- Should be: usb_outlet_2port driver
- Was paired as: switch_basic_2gang (WRONG!)

ROOT CAUSE - MANUFACTURER ID CONFLICT:
_TZ3000_h1ipgkwn was in BOTH drivers:
- ✅ usb_outlet_1gang (correct)
- ✅ usb_outlet_2port (correct)
- ❌ switch_basic_2gang (WRONG! Caused mis-pairing)

Also found other USB IDs incorrectly in switch_basic_2gang:
- _TZ3000_kqvb5akv (USB)
- _TZ3000_ww6drja5 (USB)
- _TZ3000_ltt60asa (USB)
- _TZ3000_akqdg6g7 (USB)

FIXES APPLIED:
1. ✅ Removed measure_battery from switch_basic_2gang (AC powered)
2. ✅ Removed _TZ3000_h1ipgkwn from switch_basic_2gang manufacturer list
3. ✅ Kept _TZ3000_h1ipgkwn in usb_outlet drivers (correct)

RESULT:
- USB devices with _TZ3000_h1ipgkwn will now pair as usb_outlet_2port
- No more confusion with switch_basic_2gang
- User must re-pair device to get correct driver

USER IMPACT:
Device currently:
- Name: "Switch 2gang" (wrong)
- Driver: switch_basic_2gang (wrong)  
- Has: measure_battery (wrong)
- Status: Dropped from Zigbee network

After v4.9.66 update + re-pair:
- Name: "USB Outlet - 2 Ports" (correct)
- Driver: usb_outlet_2port (correct)
- Has: onoff + onoff.usb2 (correct, 2 buttons)
- Should: Stay on network + respond to commands

FILES CHANGED:
- app.json: v4.9.66
- drivers/switch_basic_2gang/driver.compose.json:
  * Removed measure_battery capability
  * Removed battery config
  * Removed USB manufacturer IDs

USER ACTION REQUIRED:
1. Update to v4.9.66
2. Remove mis-paired "Switch 2gang" device
3. Re-pair USB 2-port outlet
4. Should now pair as "USB Outlet - 2 Ports"
