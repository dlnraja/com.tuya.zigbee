---

Dear Athom Support Team,

I am writing to request urgent assistance with my Homey app **com.dlnraja.tuya.zigbee**, which is experiencing critical build failures preventing 49 active users from receiving updates.

### ISSUE DETAILS

**App ID:** com.dlnraja.tuya.zigbee  
**Failed Builds:** #264, #265, #266, #267, #268  
**Date/Time:** October 21, 2025 (10:39 - 11:29 UTC+2)  
**Error:** Processing failed (AggregateError)  
**Impact:** 49 local installations unable to receive updates  

### BUILD HISTORY

- Build #264: v4.0.5 - Processing failed (10:39)
- Build #265: v4.0.6 - Processing failed (11:01)
- Build #266: v4.0.7 - Processing failed (11:14)
- Build #267: v4.0.8 - Processing failed (11:27)
- Build #268: v4.0.8 - Processing failed (11:29)

All 5 builds failed with the same error within 50 minutes.

### APP METRICS

**Current Configuration:**
- Total Drivers: 319
- app.json Size: 3.58 MB
- Manufacturer IDs: 521 unique
- Flow Cards: 374 (65 actions + 231 triggers + 78 conditions)
- Repository Size: 815 MB

**Validation Status:**
- Local validation: ‚úÖ PASS (`homey app validate --level publish`)
- Local build: ‚úÖ PASS (`homey app build`)
- Server build: ‚ùå FAIL (timeout/processing error)

### COMPARISON WITH SIMILAR APPS

**Johan Bendz com.tuya.zigbee:**
- Drivers: ~250
- app.json: ~2.5 MB
- Build Status: ‚úÖ SUCCESS

**Our app:**
- Drivers: 319 (+27%)
- app.json: 3.58 MB (+43%)
- Build Status: ‚ùå TIMEOUT

We appear to have exceeded a threshold where the build server becomes unstable.

### IMPACT ON USERS

**Current Situation:**
- 49 active users with local installations
- Stuck on last working version (likely < 4.0.4)
- Cannot receive bug fixes or new features
- Version numbers 4.0.5-4.0.8 wasted on failed builds

**User Experience Impact:**
- Critical IAS Zone crash fixes blocked (v4.0.4 includes major stability improvements)
- New device support blocked (GIRIER devices added)
- SDK3 compliance improvements blocked

### REQUEST

We respectfully request assistance with the following:

1. **Increase build timeout** for app com.dlnraja.tuya.zigbee
   - Our analysis suggests the build process is timing out due to the high number of drivers (319)
   
2. **Allocate more memory** to the build process
   - 3.58 MB app.json + 319 drivers may require additional server resources
   
3. **Provide detailed error logs** for builds #264-268
   - Understanding the exact failure point would help us optimize further
   
4. **Guidance on recommended limits**
   - Maximum recommended driver count
   - Maximum recommended app.json size
   - Best practices for large apps

5. **Temporary build priority** (if possible)
   - 49 users are waiting for critical updates

### OUR MITIGATION PLAN

While awaiting your response, we are:

1. **Analyzing mergeable drivers**
   - Identified 91 drivers that can be merged (battery variants)
   - Would reduce from 319 ‚Üí 228 drivers
   - Target: ~220 drivers

2. **Suspending all publish attempts**
   - No further builds until issue resolved
   - Preventing version number waste

3. **Preparing reduced version**
   - Will publish reduced version if server limits cannot be increased

### TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Validation Proof:**
```bash
$ homey app validate --level publish
‚úì Validating app...
‚úì App validated successfully against level `publish`
```

**Build Success (Local):**
```bash
$ homey app build
‚úì App built successfully
```

**Server Failure:**
- All 5 builds fail at "Processing" stage
- No specific error details provided in dashboard
- AggregateError suggests multiple sub-failures

### URGENCY

This issue is blocking:
- 49 active users from updates
- Critical stability improvements (IAS Zone fixes)
- Community contributions (new device support)
- SDK3 compliance work

We would greatly appreciate any assistance you can provide to resolve this issue.
