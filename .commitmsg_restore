fix: CRITICAL - Restore broken drivers from failed enrichment

PROBLEM: Mass enrichment script BROKE 6 drivers by removing class declarations

BROKEN FILES RESTORED:
- climate_monitor_temp_humidity/device.js
- climate_sensor_soil/device.js
- air_quality_monitor/device.js
- air_quality_comprehensive/device.js
- air_quality_pm25/device.js
- presence_sensor_radar/device.js

CAUSE:
Enrichment script (APPLY_BEST_PRACTICES_MASSIVE.js) had bug that:
1. Removed 'use strict' and class declaration
2. Left only methods without wrapping class
3. Result: "No class found" error + drivers non-functional

FIXED:
Restored all files from commit 765e170cdd (before enrichment)
Files now have correct structure with class declarations

VERIFICATION:
All drivers now have:
✅ 'use strict';
✅ const BaseHybridDevice = require...
✅ class XxxDevice extends BaseHybridDevice {
✅ Complete methods

STATUS: Drivers restored to working state from v4.9.145
