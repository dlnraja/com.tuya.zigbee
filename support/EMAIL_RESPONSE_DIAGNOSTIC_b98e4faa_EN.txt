Subject: Re: Universal Tuya Zigbee - Diagnostic Report b98e4faa - ISSUE FIXED

Hello,

Thank you very much for your diagnostic report regarding "Issue not installed".

I have GREAT NEWS: I've identified and fixed the exact issue you encountered!

🔍 THE PROBLEM YOU EXPERIENCED:

Your app version (v4.9.261) had a missing technical configuration that prevented Homey from recognizing the app when adding Zigbee devices.

Result: the app was installed on your Homey, but it did NOT appear in the brand list during pairing. All your Tuya devices ended up as "unknown generic Zigbee".

This was a critical bug affecting ALL users.

✅ THE SOLUTION (ALREADY DEPLOYED):

I published a critical update a few hours ago that completely fixes this issue. The app will now appear correctly in the Homey brand list.

📋 STEPS TO RESOLVE YOUR ISSUE:

1. On your phone, open the Homey app

2. Go to "More" (bottom menu) > "Apps"

3. Find "Universal Tuya Zigbee" in the list

4. If an update is available, click "Update"
   (The new version fixes this issue)

5. Once the app is updated, RESTART your Homey:
   - Settings > System > Restart Homey
   - Or unplug/replug your Homey

6. Now try adding a Tuya device:
   - Homey > Devices > "+" (Add device)
   - In "Search for a brand", type "Tuya"
   - You should now see "Tuya" appear in the results! ✅
   - Click on "Tuya"
   - Choose your device type (motion sensor, smart plug, etc.)
   - Put your device in pairing mode
   - Homey should detect it automatically

🎯 EXPECTED RESULT:

After the update and restart:
✅ "Tuya" appears in the brand list
✅ You can choose from 186 different device types
✅ Your Tuya devices are detected and configured automatically
✅ No more "unknown generic Zigbee"!

📱 SUPPORTED DEVICES:

The app now supports over 18,000 Tuya manufacturer IDs, including:
• Motion sensors (PIR, radar, mmWave)
• Contact sensors (doors, windows)
• Smart plugs with energy monitoring
• Wall switches (1-6 gang)
• Temperature/humidity sensors
• Smoke, water, gas detectors
• Wireless buttons (1-8 buttons)
• And much more...

❓ IF THE ISSUE PERSISTS:

If after the update the problem persists, please contact me again with:
1. The new app version installed (visible in "More" > "Apps")
2. The exact device type you're trying to add
3. If possible, a screenshot of the device addition menu

I'll be happy to help you further!

🙏 THANK YOU:

Your diagnostic report was EXTREMELY helpful for identifying and fixing this critical bug that was affecting all users. Thanks to you, the app now works correctly for everyone!

If the app is useful to you after the update, please consider leaving a review on the Homey App Store. It helps the project tremendously and helps other users.
