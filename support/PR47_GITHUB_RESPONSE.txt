### ⚠️ Before Merge - Need Information

Could you please provide the **exact manufacturer ID** for your HOBEIAN ZG-303Z device?

**How to find it:**

1. **Via Homey Developer Tools**:
```javascript
// In device pairing logs, look for:
manufacturerName: "_TZ****_********"
```

2. **Via Zigbee Debug**:
```bash
homey app run
# Pair device and check console output
# Look for: "manufacturerName" attribute
```

3. **Common Tuya Patterns**:
```
_TZ3000_hobeian*
_TZE200_hobeian*
_TZE204_hobeian*
```

**Why we need this:**
The driver currently supports 20+ manufacturer IDs, but HOBEIAN ZG-303Z specific ID needs to be added to ensure proper device recognition during pairing.

---

### ✅ Test Results (Please Confirm)

Could you confirm these tests with your actual device:

- [ ] **Device Pairing**: Device successfully paired?
- [ ] **Temperature**: Reading accurate? (measure_temperature)
- [ ] **Air Humidity**: Reading accurate? (measure_humidity)
- [ ] **Soil Moisture**: Reading accurate? (measure_humidity.soil)
- [ ] **Battery**: Percentage displayed? (measure_battery)
- [ ] **Contact Alarm**: Works if device has tamper detection?

**Example test output**:
```
✅ Temperature: 22.5°C
✅ Air Humidity: 45%
✅ Soil Moisture: 35%
✅ Battery: 85%
```

### 🚀 What Happens Next

**Once manufacturer ID confirmed:**

1. ✅ I'll add the ID to `driver.compose.json`
2. ✅ Update `CHANGELOG.md`
3. ✅ Merge PR #47 to master
4. ✅ Include in **v4.10.0 release** (next 48h)
5. ✅ Publish to Homey App Store
6. ✅ Device will be available to all users

**Timeline:**
- Today: Manufacturer ID confirmation
- Tomorrow: Merge + Release
- 48h: Available on Homey App Store
