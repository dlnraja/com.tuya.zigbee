COMMON DP MAPPING PATTERNS
===========================

TS011F Smart Plugs (Power Monitoring):
- DP 1: onoff (switch state)
- DP 4: current (amps)
- DP 5: voltage (volts)
- DP 6: power (watts)
- DP 32: energy (kWh)

TS0201 Temperature/Humidity Sensors:
- DP 1: temperature (divide by 10)
- DP 2: humidity (percentage)

TS0202 Motion Sensors:
- DP 1: occupancy/motion detection
- DP 2: battery level
- Uses IAS Zone cluster (1280) for standard Zigbee reporting

Multi-gang Switches:
- DP 1: switch_1_onoff
- DP 2: switch_2_onoff (for TS0002, TS0012)
- DP 3: switch_3_onoff (for TS0003)

Lighting (TS0502B/TS0505B):
- DP 1: onoff
- DP 2: brightness
- DP 3: color_temperature
- DP 5: color (for RGBW models)

RESEARCH CHALLENGES
===================
- 25 manufacturers from the 151-200 range had no publicly documented data (no results found)
- Some manufacturers lack specific DP mappings but device type is known
- Tuya uses inconsistent DP numbering across different hardware variants
- Some devices are very new and not yet documented in open-source repositories

SOURCES USED
============
1. Zigbee2MQTT (https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt)
   - Device issues and pull requests
   - Converter definitions and device support requests

2. ZHA Device Handlers (https://github.com/zigpy/zha-device-handlers)
   - Device support requests and bug reports
   - Quirk implementations

3. Blakadder Zigbee Database (https://zigbee.blakadder.com)
   - Device compatibility information
   - Technical specifications

4. Community Forums
   - deCONZ Community (https://forum.phoscon.de)
   - Home Assistant Community (https://community.home-assistant.io)
   - Homey Community (https://community.homey.app)

TOTAL DATA POINTS
=================
- Manufacturers with data: 26
- Unique device models: 17 distinct TS models (TS0001-TS0601)
- Device types: 8 categories (switch, sensor, light, climate, remote, scene_controller)
- Average sources per manufacturer: 1.8
- DP mappings documented: 45+ individual datapoints

OUTPUT
======
Generated file: batch-4-manufacturers.json (9.4 KB)
JSON structure includes:
- Metadata (batch, range, date)
- 26 manufacturer entries with:
  * Device models (TS codes)
  * Device type classification
  * DP information (when available)
  * Capabilities list
  * Source URLs for verification

NEXT STEPS
==========
- Consider creating local converters for undocumented manufacturers
- Monitor GitHub for new device support issues
- Cross-reference DP mappings with Tuya developer documentation
- Test undocumented devices to generate empirical DP mapping data
