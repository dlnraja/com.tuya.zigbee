fix: Add scenes cluster support for Tuya TS0043/TS0044 buttons

Diagnostic e29cd366 - Buttons not triggering events

ROOT CAUSE: Tuya buttons use scenes.recall cluster, not onOff
SOLUTION: Listen to scenes cluster with priority over onOff/levelControl
IMPACT: All Tuya button devices now working (~50 drivers)
