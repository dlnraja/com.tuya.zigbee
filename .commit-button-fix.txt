fix: remove 102 obsolete button flow cards causing driver initialization crashes

- Fixed critical bug: button_1gang through button_8gang drivers no longer exist after v4.5.0 unbranded migration
- These drivers were renamed to button_wireless_*, button_remote_* following function-based naming
- Removed 102 orphaned flow card triggers that referenced non-existent drivers
- This was causing Invalid Flow Card ID errors and preventing button drivers from initializing
- Users reported lot of exclamation marks on devices due to unavailable drivers

Technical Details:
- Removed flow cards: button_1gang_*, button_2gang_*, button_3gang_*, button_4gang_*, button_6gang_*, button_8gang_*
- Flow cards reduced: 674 to 572 triggers
- Validation: PASSED at publish level
- SDK3 compliance: MAINTAINED

Impact:
- Fixes diagnostic reports showing button driver crashes
- Resolves exclamation mark issues on button devices
- Ensures all flow cards reference valid drivers only
