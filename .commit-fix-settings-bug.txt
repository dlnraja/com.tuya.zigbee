fix: 🐛 Fix settings page not opening (Issue #43)

🐛 CRITICAL BUG FIX:

PROBLEM REPORTED (Issue #43 by @sinan92):
❌ Settings page fails to load
❌ Configuration cannot be opened
❌ "onHomeyReady" function not called by Homey.js

ROOT CAUSE:
The onHomeyReady() function was not exposed globally.
Homey.js requires window.onHomeyReady to be accessible.

SOLUTION:
✅ Changed: function onHomeyReady() → window.onHomeyReady
✅ Made function globally accessible
✅ Added fallback initialization
✅ Improved error handling

CHANGES:
- settings/index.html: Fixed onHomeyReady scope (line 553-570)
- Added window.onHomeyReady = function() {}
- Added typeof Homey !== 'undefined' fallback
- Ensures settings page loads correctly

VALIDATION:
✅ Settings page now loads properly
✅ Driver search engine works
✅ Configuration accessible

Thanks to @sinan92 for reporting this critical bug!

Closes #43
