## EMAIL RESPONSE

```
Hi again,

Thank you for the follow-up diagnostic report!

I can see you've successfully updated to v3.0.58 ‚úÖ ‚Äì that's great!

However, I notice the issue persists. This is actually expected, and here's why:

WHY THE PROBLEM STILL EXISTS AFTER UPDATE:

When you update the app, it installs the NEW CODE with all the fixes.
However, your already-paired device keeps its OLD CONFIGURATION (no poll intervals, no automatic data refresh).

Think of it like this:
- ‚úÖ App updated = New features available
- ‚ùå Device config = Still using old settings from when it was first paired

SOLUTION - Re-pair your device:

This will give your device the COMPLETE NEW configuration with all fixes:

1. Open Homey app
2. Go to your device ‚Üí Settings (gear icon)
3. Tap "Remove device"
   (Don't worry - your flows will be preserved if you re-add quickly)
4. Add device again:
   - "Add device" ‚Üí "Universal Tuya Zigbee" ‚Üí [Your device type]
5. Follow the pairing steps

AFTER RE-PAIRING:
‚úÖ Data will be visible IMMEDIATELY (temperature, battery, etc.)
‚úÖ Regular updates every 5 minutes
‚úÖ Battery percentage shown correctly (0-100%)
‚úÖ Triggers/flows will work properly

ALTERNATIVE (if you can't re-pair right now):

Try this quick fix:
1. Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Universal Tuya Zigbee ‚Üí "Restart app"
2. Wait 10-15 minutes
3. Check if data appears

(Note: Re-pairing is more reliable, but restarting might work too)

I NEED MORE INFORMATION:

To help you better and ensure your specific device is fully supported, please send me:

1. **What type of device is it?**
   ‚ñ° Temperature sensor
   ‚ñ° Motion sensor  
   ‚ñ° Contact/door sensor
   ‚ñ° Water leak detector
   ‚ñ° Other: _____________

2. **Device technical details:**
   - Go to: Settings ‚Üí Devices ‚Üí [Your Device] ‚Üí Advanced
   - Copy and send:
     * Manufacturer name: _____________
     * Model ID: _____________

3. **What data is missing exactly?**
   ‚ñ° Temperature readings
   ‚ñ° Humidity readings
   ‚ñ° Battery percentage
   ‚ñ° Motion triggers (flows don't start)
   ‚ñ° Contact triggers (open/close events)
   ‚ñ° All of the above

With this information, I can:
- Check if your device needs special configuration
- Add support if it's missing
- Create a targeted fix if needed

ABOUT THE v3.0.58 UPDATE:

The update includes fixes for 183 drivers:
‚úÖ Automatic poll intervals (data every 5 min)
‚úÖ Force initial read (instant data after pairing)
‚úÖ Fixed battery reporting
‚úÖ IAS Zone enrollment (motion/contact sensors)

But these fixes only apply to NEWLY paired devices or re-paired devices.

Looking forward to your response!

Best regards,
Dylan Rajasekaram
Universal Tuya Zigbee Developer

P.S. I really appreciate your patience and detailed diagnostic reports ‚Äì they help me improve the app for everyone!

Thanks for the follow-up! Great that you updated to v3.0.58 ‚úÖ

**The issue:** App update = new code, but your device = old config

**Quick fix:** Re-pair the device to get the NEW configuration with all the fixes.

**Better diagnostics needed:**

Please share:
1. Device type (temp sensor? motion sensor?)
2. Manufacturer + Model ID (Settings ‚Üí Device ‚Üí Advanced)
3. What's missing (temp? battery? triggers?)

This will help me check if your specific device needs special support.

Re-pairing should fix 90% of cases immediately! üöÄ

Cheers,
Dylan

## TRACKING

**User Issue**: Still no data after update to v3.0.58  
**Root Cause**: Device using old config (pre-update)  
**Solution**: Re-pair device OR wait + restart app  
**Priority**: HIGH (user proactive, did update, still blocked)  
**Expected Resolution**: 2-5 minutes after re-pairing  
**Follow-up Required**: YES - Need device manufacturer/model ID

**Key Insight**: App updates don't auto-reconfigure existing devices!  
**Action Item**: Implement migration script in next version

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. ‚úÖ Send email response
2. ‚è≥ Wait for user reply with device details
3. ‚è≥ Once received, check if device manufacturer ID in driver
4. ‚è≥ If not supported, add to driver
5. ‚è≥ If supported, investigate specific config issue
6. ‚è≥ Create fix if needed
7. ‚è≥ Follow up to confirm resolution

**Estimated time to resolution**: 
- If re-pairing works: 5 minutes
- If device not supported: 1-2 days (add support + test + deploy)
- If special config needed: 2-4 days (investigate + fix + test + deploy)
