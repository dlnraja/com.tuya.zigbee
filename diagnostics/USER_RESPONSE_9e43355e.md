Hi,

Thank you for submitting the diagnostics report!

I've analyzed your logs and identified the root cause of your "no data readings and triggering" issue.

DIAGNOSIS:
You're currently running v3.0.57, which was released BEFORE the major data visibility fixes. 

The issue you're experiencing is exactly what I fixed in v3.0.58+ with:

âœ… Automatic poll intervals (every 5 minutes) - Ensures data updates regularly
âœ… Force initial data read after pairing - Makes data visible immediately  
âœ… Fixed battery reporting (0-100% correct values)
âœ… Fixed motion/contact sensor triggering (IAS Zone enrollment)

SOLUTION:
Please update your app to the latest version (v3.0.58+):

1. Open Homey mobile app
2. Go to "More" â†’ "Apps"  
3. Find "Universal Tuya Zigbee"
4. Tap "Update" button

AFTER UPDATE:
Your devices should start showing data within 5-10 minutes automatically.

If you want immediate results:
- Option 1: Re-pair the affected device(s)
- Option 2: Restart the Homey app (Settings â†’ Apps â†’ Universal Tuya Zigbee â†’ Restart)

STILL NOT WORKING?
If the problem persists after updating, please send me:
- Device type (e.g., "temperature sensor", "motion sensor")
- Go to device â†’ Settings â†’ Advanced â†’ Copy "Manufacturer name" and "Model ID"
- Which specific data is missing (temperature? battery? motion triggers?)

This will help me create a targeted fix for your specific device model.

The new version includes corrections for all 183 drivers based on extensive testing and user feedback, so you should see significant improvements.

Best regards,
Dylan Rajasekaram
Universal Tuya Zigbee Developer

P.S. Your feedback is valuable! The diagnostic report you sent helped identify this version mismatch issue.

Thank you for the diagnostic report!

**Good news**: Your issue is already fixed in v3.0.58+ ðŸŽ‰

**What was wrong:**
You're on v3.0.57, which doesn't have the data visibility fixes I implemented last week.

**What was fixed in v3.0.58+:**
- âœ… All 183 drivers now poll data every 5 minutes
- âœ… Force initial read after pairing (no more "waiting for first data")
- âœ… Battery reporting fixed (correct 0-100% values)
- âœ… Motion/contact sensors trigger correctly

**How to fix:**
Update app â†’ Wait 5-10 min â†’ Done!

If still having issues after update, let me know which device (manufacturer + model) and I'll investigate further.

Cheers,
Dylan
