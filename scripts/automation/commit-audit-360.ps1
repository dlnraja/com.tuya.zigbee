feat: Audit 360° Implementation - DP Engine, Local-First, CI Complete

COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT IMPLEMENTATION:

✅ TUYA DP ENGINE (Local-First Foundation):
- lib/tuya-dp-engine/ complete architecture
- Fingerprints database (100+ devices)
- Profiles system (20+ profiles)
- Capability mapping (comprehensive)
- Converters (power, temperature, onoff)
- Reusable traits system
- Auto-detection fallbacks
- Future: 183 → 500+ drivers scalable

✅ LOCAL-FIRST DOCUMENTATION:
- docs/LOCAL_FIRST.md (comprehensive guide)
- Why local > cloud explained
- Real-world examples (Tuya 2024 issues)
- Performance comparison tables
- Security analysis
- Test procedures
- 10-50ms vs 500-2000ms latency

✅ CI/CD COMPLETE WORKFLOW:
- .github/workflows/ci-complete.yml
- 7 jobs: validate, matrix, schema, export, badges, PR comment, summary
- Device matrix auto-generation (MD, CSV, JSON)
- Coverage stats with HTML dashboard
- Badges generation (drivers, variants, health)
- PR comments with coverage
- All artifacts uploaded (30-90 days retention)

✅ POSITIONING & ARCHITECTURE:
- Clear Local Zigbee vs Cloud comparison
- Johan Bendz attribution prominent
- Athom Tuya Cloud differentiation
- DP-centric architecture documented
- Profiles > drivers approach
- Community-contributable JSON profiles

TECHNICAL FOUNDATIONS:

DP Engine Benefits:
- Write converter once, use everywhere
- Declarative drivers (just JSON)
- Easy device additions (add profile)
- Testable (pure functions)
- Maintainable (fix once = all devices)
- Scalable (183 → 500+ without explosion)

CI/CD Benefits:
- Verifiable claims (artifacts)
- Transparent methodology
- Auto-generated matrix
- Coverage tracking
- Build quality gates
- Community confidence

Local-First Benefits:
- 10-50ms latency (vs 500-2000ms cloud)
- 99.9%+ reliability
- Works offline 100%
- Total privacy
- No subscriptions
- Better battery life (Zigbee)

STATISTICS:
- DP Engine: 20+ profiles, 100+ fingerprints
- Converters: Power, temp, onoff (expandable)
- CI Jobs: 7 parallel validations
- Artifacts: 6 types (logs, matrix, stats, exports)
- Documentation: 3 major docs (LOCAL_FIRST, DP Engine, WHY_THIS_APP)

This implements the complete professional audit recommendations,
establishing foundation for 500+ device scalability with local-first
Zigbee control and transparent, verifiable quality standards.
