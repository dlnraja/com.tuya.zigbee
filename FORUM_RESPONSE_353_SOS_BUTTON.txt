Hi Peter,

Thank you for the detailed report and diagnostic code!

I've identified the issue with the SOS button instability. The problem occurs because:
1. IAS Zone enrollment wasn't completing properly after rename/settings change
2. No keep-alive mechanism to maintain connection
3. Device timing out after configuration changes

**Fix applied in latest version:**

✅ **Robust IAS Zone enrollment** - Multiple retry attempts with fallback methods
✅ **Keep-alive polling** - Device polled every 30 minutes to maintain connection
✅ **Rename handling** - Configuration preserved during rename
✅ **Low battery alert** - Warning when CR2032 < 20%
✅ **Auto-recovery** - Automatic reconnection after errors

**Please update to the latest app version and try again:**
1. Remove the SOS button from Homey
2. Update the app via App Store
3. Re-add the device
4. It should now stay stable even after rename/settings changes

The diagnostic code you provided shows the device was losing IAS Zone enrollment. This is now fixed with a more robust enrollment system.

Let me know if this resolves your issue!

Best regards,
Dylan
