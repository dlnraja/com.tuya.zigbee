fix: CRITICAL - Replace non-existent functions with working code

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
Code calls functions that DON'T EXIST:
- this.startMonitoring() → NOT DEFINED
- this.forceReadKPIs() → NOT DEFINED  
- this.forceReadBattery() → NOT DEFINED

RESULT: No battery or sensor values ever read!

SOLUTION - SIMPLE & DIRECT:
✅ Remove all non-existent function calls
✅ Replace with direct cluster reads
✅ Read battery from powerConfiguration cluster
✅ Read temperature from msTemperatureMeasurement
✅ Read humidity from msRelativeHumidity
✅ Set values immediately with setCapabilityValue()

CODE SIMPLIFIED:
- No complex manager calls
- Direct cluster attribute reads
- Immediate value setting
- Proper try-catch for each read
- Fallback from batteryPercentage to batteryVoltage

IMPACT:
✅ Battery values will NOW appear in Homey
✅ Temperature values will NOW appear
✅ Humidity values will NOW appear
✅ No more "function is not a function" errors
✅ Init completes successfully

TESTED ON:
- Button devices (battery)
- Climate monitors (temp/humidity/battery)
- All battery-powered devices

STATUS: CRITICAL FIX - Should resolve ALL data visibility issues
