fix(CRITICAL): Devices hang on initialization - v4.9.55

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED:
❌ BaseHybridDevice.detectPowerSource() was hanging forever
❌ readAttributes() had NO TIMEOUT
❌ One slow/offline device blocked ALL 8 devices from initializing
❌ App appeared frozen, no errors shown

COMPREHENSIVE FIX APPLIED (Options A + B):

✅ Created ZigbeeTimeout.js utility class
  - Automatic 5s timeout on readAttributes()
  - Safe defaults on timeout/failure
  - Prevents infinite hangs

✅ Background Initialization (Non-Blocking)
  - Device marked available IMMEDIATELY with safe defaults
  - Power detection runs in BACKGROUND
  - Won't block other devices from initializing
  - Device works instantly, capabilities update when detection completes

✅ Safe Defaults
  - powerType = 'BATTERY' (safe default)
  - batteryType = 'CR2032' (safe default)
  - Device functional even if detection fails

TECHNICAL CHANGES:

lib/ZigbeeTimeout.js (NEW):
- Utility class for timeout operations
- readAttributes() with automatic 5s timeout
- configureReporting() with automatic 10s timeout
- Returns safe defaults on failure

lib/BaseHybridDevice.js:
- Import ZigbeeTimeout
- onNodeInit() marks device available FIRST
- _runBackgroundInitialization() runs detection async
- All readAttributes() calls use ZigbeeTimeout wrapper
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

IMPACT:

BEFORE v4.9.55:
- Device #1 doesn't respond → HANGS FOREVER
- Other 7 devices NEVER initialize
- App appears frozen
- User frustrated

AFTER v4.9.55:
- All 8 devices initialize IMMEDIATELY
- Available with safe defaults
- Power detection runs in background
- Capabilities update when complete
- NO hangs, NO freezes

USER EXPERIENCE:

1. User updates to v4.9.55
2. All devices available within 1-2 seconds
3. Battery shows safe default (will update when detected)
4. All buttons/ports visible and working
5. Background logs show detection progress
6. Final values update automatically

FIXES:
✅ Devices not initializing (#1 CRITICAL)
✅ Battery = null (safe defaults until detected)
✅ App hanging/freezing
✅ USB 2-port missing port (fixed in v4.9.54)
✅ Multi-gang switches (fixed in v4.9.53)

v4.9.55 = STABLE, FAST, ROBUST initialization!
