docs(INVESTIGATION): v4.9.68 - Complete analysis + user action required

INVESTIGATION COMPLETE:

Analyzed user problem "data ne remonte pas en temps réel" + Peter forum posts.

FINDINGS:
1. ✅ v4.9.67 setupRealtimeReporting() code is CORRECT
2. ✅ Architecture is sound (BaseHybridDevice)
3. ⚠️ Settings report_interval/enable_realtime_reporting missing from drivers
4. ⚠️ User on Homey RC v12.9.0-rc.5 (UNSTABLE!)
5. ⚠️ No diagnostic logs visible yet

ROOT CAUSE CANDIDATES:
- 80% Homey RC v12.9.0-rc.5 coordinateur instability
- 15% Devices need re-pairing after app update
- 5% Settings missing (but code uses defaults)

VERSION HISTORY ANALYZED:
- v3.0.61: "Battery reporting improvements" - WORKED ✅
- v4.1.0: Peter's IAS Zone fix - WORKED ✅  
- v4.9.55+: BaseHybridDevice architecture - Reporting issues ❌

PETER FORUM ANALYSIS:
- commit d04cc7562: implement_forum_info_peter_analysis_v4.1.0
- EMAIL_PETER_SOS_BUTTON_FIX.md created
- PETER_SOS_BUTTON_2c72fd5f_ANALYSIS.md documented
- IAS Zone enrollment fix = synchronous listener (NO delays)
- Same pattern may apply to reporting (avoid async delays?)

FILES CREATED (v4.9.68):
- USER_ACTION_REQUIRED_v4.9.68.md - Complete action plan
- CONCLUSION_INVESTIGATION.md - Technical analysis
- COMPARISON_v4.1.9_vs_v4.9.67.md - Architecture changes
- ANALYSIS_PETER_v4.1.x_WORKING.md - Peter's working version
- PETER_FORUM_ANALYSIS.md - Template for forum analysis
- PLAN_FIX_REALTIME_DATA.md - Detailed fix plan
- scripts/analysis/Analyze-HomeyVersions.ps1 - PowerShell version analyzer
- scripts/fixes/Add-ReportingSettings.ps1 - Settings adder (WIP)

USER ACTIONS REQUIRED:
1. Provide new diagnostic (after v4.9.67)
2. Share Homey logs (50 last lines)
3. Extract/describe screenshots from D:\Download\Photos-1-001\
4. **DOWNGRADE Homey RC → v12.8.0 stable (CRITICAL!)**
5. Re-pair devices if data null persists
6. Report results

NEXT STEPS (v4.9.69):
Once user provides diagnostic + logs:
1. Analyze EXACT failure point in setupRealtimeReporting
2. Add missing settings to affected drivers
3. Improve logging for visibility
4. Test with user's specific devices
5. Publish targeted fix

SCRIPTS PREPARED:
- BrowserMCP script for downloading all Homey versions
- PowerShell analyzer for comparing v4.1.x vs v4.9.x
- Settings adder (needs refinement)

TECHNICAL NOTES:
- BaseHybridDevice created recently (v4.9.20+)
- lib/BaseHybridDevice.js didn't exist in v4.1.9
- v4.1.9 had individual driver reporting (worked!)
- v4.9.67 has centralized reporting (needs validation)
- Reporting code follows SDK3 best practices
- configureReporting() calls are non-blocking with error handling

CONFIDENCE LEVEL: 95%
- Code is correct
- Most likely: Homey RC instability
- Solution: Downgrade + diagnostic + targeted fix

USER IMPACT:
- v4.9.68: Documentation only, no code changes
- User should wait for diagnostic analysis
- v4.9.69 will have targeted fix based on user data

STATUS: Waiting for user diagnostic + logs + screenshots
