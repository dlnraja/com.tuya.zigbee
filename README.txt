Control your Tuya-based Zigbee devices locally through Homey Pro. This app supports over 60 device types including switches, dimmers, sensors, thermostats, covers, plugs, buttons, IR blasters and more, with both standard Zigbee (ZCL) and Tuya-specific (DP) protocol handling for maximum compatibility.

Pair your devices directly with Homey without needing the Tuya cloud. The app automatically detects the correct protocol for your device and provides flow cards for automation, physical button detection, and advanced settings like power-on behavior, backlight control and child lock.
