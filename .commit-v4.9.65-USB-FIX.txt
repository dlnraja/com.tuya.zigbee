fix(CRITICAL): v4.9.65 - Remove measure_battery from ALL USB outlet drivers

CRITICAL BUG FIXED:
All USB outlet drivers had measure_battery capability + CR2032 battery config
→ USB outlets are AC POWERED, not battery powered!
→ This caused devices to show battery % instead of working properly

USER REPORT:
- USB 2-port showing only 1 button instead of 2
- No data reporting
- No response to commands
- Problem started 2 days ago (after update to v4.9.64?)

ROOT CAUSE:
measure_battery capability was incorrectly added to:
- usb_outlet_1gang
- usb_outlet_2port  
- usb_outlet_3gang

This made devices think they were battery powered when they're AC powered!

FIXES APPLIED:
✅ usb_outlet_1gang: Removed measure_battery + batteries config
✅ usb_outlet_2port: Removed measure_battery + batteries config
✅ usb_outlet_3gang: Removed measure_battery + batteries config

RESULT:
All USB outlets now correctly configured as AC powered devices only.

USER ACTION REQUIRED:
After update to v4.9.65:
1. Remove USB device from Homey
2. Re-pair USB device
3. Should now show correct number of buttons (1, 2, or 3)
4. Should respond to commands

TESTING:
✓ homey app build - SUCCESS
✓ All USB drivers now AC powered only
✓ No battery capabilities

FILES CHANGED:
- app.json: v4.9.65
- drivers/usb_outlet_1gang/driver.compose.json
- drivers/usb_outlet_2port/driver.compose.json
- drivers/usb_outlet_3gang/driver.compose.json

NEXT STEPS:
- User needs to check screenshots in ZIP
- Identify exact drivers for "switches CR2032" issue
- May need to re-pair devices with correct driver
