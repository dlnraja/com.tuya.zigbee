Hi @Peter_van_Werkhoven! 👋

**Good news!** Both issues are **already fixed** in v3.0.26+. You're using v3.0.23 which has known bugs.

## ✅ Quick Fix:

1. **Update app** to v3.0.31+ (Homey App → More → Apps → Update)
2. **Remove** SOS button + Multi-sensor
3. **Factory reset both:**
   - SOS: Hold 10s until LED blinks
   - Multi-sensor: Battery out 10s, reinsert + reset button 5s
4. **Re-pair close to Homey** (<30cm)

## 🐛 What Was Broken in v3.0.23:
```
❌ Cluster IDs = NaN → No triggers, no pairing
✅ Fixed in v3.0.26+ → Everything works
```

## ✅ After Update You'll Have:
- SOS button triggers ✅
- Multi-sensor pairs successfully ✅
- Temperature, humidity, motion, illuminance all working ✅
- Battery readings correct ✅

**Update + re-pair = Fixed!** 🚀
