Subject: RE: Universal Tuya Zigbee - Diagnostic 46c66060

Hi Peter,

Thank you for the detailed update and the new diagnostic report (46c66060).

I understand the frustration - you've been very thorough with your troubleshooting steps.

Before I analyze the new diagnostic, I need to verify one critical thing:

**IMPORTANT: Which version of the Universal Tuya Zigbee app do you currently have installed?**

To check:
1. Open Homey App
2. Go to Settings > Apps
3. Find "Universal Tuya Zigbee"
4. Check the version number shown

The latest hotfix is **v3.1.4**, which was released today (about 1-2 hours ago) specifically to fix the issues you reported.

**If you see v3.1.2 or v3.1.3:**
The hotfix hasn't reached you yet. The Homey App Store can take up to 24 hours to propagate updates to all users. In this case, please wait for the auto-update or try manually updating the app.

**If you see v3.1.4:**
The hotfix is installed, but there may be additional issues I need to investigate. I'll analyze your new diagnostic report (46c66060) in detail to identify any remaining problems.

Please let me know the version number, and I'll proceed accordingly.

**What was fixed in v3.1.4:**
1. Motion sensor initialization error (duplicate variable declaration)
2. SOS button battery registration error (cluster format issue)
3. 100+ additional cluster format corrections across all battery-powered devices

**Expected behavior after v3.1.4:**
- Devices initialize correctly
- Battery level reports properly
- Motion detection triggers work
- Temperature/humidity/lux data appears

Thank you for your patience, Peter. I'm committed to getting your devices working properly.

Best regards,

P.S. If you'd like to help speed up the process, you can manually check for updates in the Homey App Store or force restart the Homey app after checking for updates.
