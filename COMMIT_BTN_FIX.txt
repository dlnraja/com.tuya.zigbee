fix(CRITICAL): Tuya buttons groups join + bind for event capture

DIAGNOSTIC: 8a32e4ad - Buttons not capturing events

ROOT CAUSE:
- Tuya TS0043/TS0044 use GROUPS cluster for broadcasting
- Events sent as multicast not direct commands
- Listeners configured but NO binding = NO events

SOLUTION:
- Join group 0 on each endpoint BEFORE listening
- Bind scenes + onOff clusters to coordinator
- groupsCluster.add before cluster.on
- cluster.bind before cluster.on

Device: _TZ3000_bgtzm4ny TS0044
User: Meme etat rien ne marche
Fix: Groups join + bind CRITICAL for Tuya buttons
