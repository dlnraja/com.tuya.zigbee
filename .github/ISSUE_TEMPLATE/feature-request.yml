      description: What problem would this feature solve?
      placeholder: |
        Currently there's no way to control RGB color from flows for Tuya RGB bulbs.
        Users have to manually adjust color in the device settings.

      label: Proposed Solution
      description: How do you envision this feature working?
      placeholder: |
        Add a flow action card "Set color" that accepts:
        - Hue (0-360)
        - Saturation (0-100)
        - Brightness (0-100)
        
        This would map to Tuya DP 24 (color hex).

      label: Alternatives Considered
      description: Have you considered other solutions?
      placeholder: |
        - Using separate apps for color control (but loses local control benefits)
        - Creating advanced flows with logic cards (too complex for users)
