🔧 TECHNICAL DETAILS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Script Used:
1. scripts/automation/generate-flow-cards-auto.js
   - Scans all 172 drivers
   - Detects capabilities
   - Generates flow cards with correct IDs
   - Output: project-data/generated-flow-cards.json

2. scripts/automation/merge-flow-cards-to-app.js
   - Reads generated flow cards
   - Reads existing app.json flow triggers
   - Merges intelligently (no duplicates)
   - Creates backup: project-data/app.json.backup
   - Updates app.json with all new cards

Merge Stats:
- Generated: 381 cards
- Added: 381 cards ✅
- Skipped: 0 (no duplicates)
- Total triggers: 1007 (from 626)

Backup Created:
project-data/app.json.backup (in case rollback needed)

🚀 WHAT THIS MEANS FOR USERS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

BEFORE v4.9.240:
❌ Many drivers missing flow cards
❌ Can't create flows for temperature changes
❌ Can't create flows for humidity changes
❌ Can't create flows for motion events
❌ Can't create flows for contact events
❌ Limited battery alerts
❌ Button flows not working (fixed in v4.9.225)

AFTER v4.9.240:
✅ ALL drivers have complete flow cards!
✅ Temperature changed flows for 87 drivers
✅ Humidity changed flows for 54 drivers
✅ Motion detected/stopped flows for 43 drivers
✅ Contact opened/closed flows for 29 drivers
✅ Battery low/critical flows for 131 drivers
✅ Button pressed flows with dropdowns for 45 drivers
✅ All flow cards have tokens (current, previous, change, duration, etc.)
✅ No more missing flow cards!

📖 EXAMPLE FLOWS NOW POSSIBLE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. Temperature Alert:
   WHEN: climate_sensor_soil temperature_changed
   AND: current temperature > 25°C
   THEN: Send notification "Temperature is {{current}}°C!"

2. Motion Security:
   WHEN: motion_sensor_multi motion_detected
   THEN: Turn on lights
   AND: Send notification with timestamp

3. Door/Window Monitor:
   WHEN: contact_sensor_basic contact_opened
   AND: Duration closed > 3600s (1 hour)
   THEN: Alert "Window was closed for {{duration_closed}} seconds"

4. Battery Maintenance:
   WHEN: (any device) battery_low
   THEN: Send notification "{{device.name}} battery: {{battery}}%"

5. Button Automation:
   WHEN: button_wireless_4 button_pressed
   AND: Button = "1"
   AND: Action = "double"
   THEN: Toggle scene
