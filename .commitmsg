fix: URGENT - Disable dynamic system temporarily

CRITICAL ISSUE: Devices not recognized anymore
All devices fall back to generic "device zigbee"

ROOT CAUSE: Dynamic system may be interfering with initial device matching

SOLUTION:
- Temporarily DISABLE DeviceMigrationManager
- Temporarily DISABLE DynamicCapabilityManager  
- Keep ALL manufacturer IDs in drivers (still present)
- Let Homey match devices normally FIRST
- Dynamic system will be re-enabled AFTER testing

IMPACT:
✅ Device recognition should work again
✅ Manufacturer IDs still present in all drivers
❌ No dynamic capabilities (temporarily)
❌ No migration (temporarily)

STATUS: TESTING - Need to verify device pairing works
