# 🔧 Workflows Fix Report - GitHub Actions

**Date:** 2025-10-11 14:34  
**Issue:** GitHub Actions failing with uncommitted changes  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## 🐛 Problem Identified

### Error Details

**Workflow:** `homey-official-publish.yml`  
**Job:** `version-and-publish`  
**Step:** Publish to Homey App Store  
**Error:**
```
? There are uncommitted changes. Are you sure you want to continue? (y/N)
Error: Process completed with exit code 130.
```

### Root Cause

1. **Action `athombv/github-action-homey-app-update-version`** modifies `app.json` and `.homeychangelog.json`
2. **Commit step** commits these changes
3. **Action `athombv/github-action-homey-app-publish`** runs on dirty working directory
4. **Homey CLI** detects uncommitted changes (build artifacts) and prompts for confirmation
5. **No response** to prompt causes exit code 130 (SIGINT)

### Uncommitted Files Causing Issue

- Build artifacts in `.homeybuild/`
- Cache files in `node_modules/.cache/`
- Potential temporary files from npm install

---

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### Solution 1: CI/CD Test Workflow (Temporary)

**File:** `.github/workflows/CI_CD_TEST.yml`

**Approach:**
- Validates and builds app
- Commits ALL changes (including build artifacts)
- Does NOT auto-publish (manual step required)
- Safer for debugging

**Features:**
- ✅ Complete validation at publish level
- ✅ Build artifact generation
- ✅ Auto-commit of build changes
- ✅ Upload artifacts for manual review
- ✅ No risky auto-publish

**Usage:**
```bash
# Triggers automatically on push
git push origin master

# Or manual dispatch
GitHub → Actions → CI/CD Pipeline with Pre-checks → Run workflow
```

---

### Solution 2: Fixed Official Workflow (Disabled for now)

**File:** `.github/workflows/homey-official-publish.yml.disabled`

**Changes Made:**
1. **Commit ALL changes** with `git add -A` (not just app.json)
2. **Fresh checkout** after commit before publish
3. **Reinstall dependencies** in clean state
4. **Separate steps** for versioning and publishing

**Key Improvements:**
```yaml
- name: Commit Version Changes
  run: |
    git add -A  # ← All changes, not just app.json
    git commit -m "chore: bump version [skip ci]"
    git push origin HEAD

- name: Fresh Checkout for Publication
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    ref: master  # ← Clean state from repo

- name: Publish to Homey App Store
  uses: athombv/github-action-homey-app-publish@master
  # ← Now runs on clean working directory
```

**Status:** Disabled until HOMEY_PAT is configured and tested

---

## 🎯 Recommended Approach

### Phase 1: Validation Only (Current)

Use **CI_CD_TEST.yml** workflow:

**Pros:**
- ✅ Safe (no auto-publish)
- ✅ Validates app
- ✅ Builds artifacts
- ✅ No HOMEY_PAT required yet
- ✅ Manual control over publication

**Cons:**
- ❌ Manual publication step required
- ❌ Not fully automated

**Workflow:**
```
Push → Validate → Build → Commit Artifacts → Download → Manual Publish
```

---

### Phase 2: Full Automation (After Testing)

Use **homey-official-publish.yml** workflow:

**Requirements:**
1. ✅ Configure `HOMEY_PAT` secret in GitHub
2. ✅ Test workflow with manual dispatch first
3. ✅ Verify version bump works
4. ✅ Verify publication succeeds

**Workflow:**
```
Push → Validate → Version → Commit → Fresh Checkout → Publish → Dashboard
```

---

## 📋 Migration Steps

### Step 1: Test Current Setup

```bash
# Make a trivial change
git commit --allow-empty -m "test: CI/CD validation"
git push origin master

# Verify on GitHub Actions
https://github.com/dlnraja/com.tuya.zigbee/actions
```

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Validation passes
- ✅ Build completes
- ✅ Artifacts uploaded
- ✅ No errors

---

### Step 2: Configure HOMEY_PAT

**Only when Step 1 succeeds:**

1. **Get token:**
   ```
   https://tools.developer.homey.app
   → Account → Personal Access Tokens
   → Create new token
   ```

2. **Add to GitHub:**
   ```
   https://github.com/dlnraja/com.tuya.zigbee/settings/secrets/actions
   → New repository secret
     Name: HOMEY_PAT
     Value: <token>
   ```

---

### Step 3: Enable Full Workflow

**Only when Step 2 is complete:**

```bash
# Re-enable official workflow
git mv .github/workflows/homey-official-publish.yml.disabled .github/workflows/homey-official-publish.yml

# Disable test workflow
git mv .github/workflows/CI_CD_TEST.yml .github/workflows/CI_CD_TEST.yml.disabled

# Commit and test
git add .github/workflows/
git commit -m "feat: enable full publication workflow"
git push origin master
```

---

### Step 4: Manual Dispatch Test

```
GitHub → Actions → Official Homey App Store Publication
  → Run workflow
    Branch: master
    Version: patch
    Changelog: "Test automated publication"
  → Run workflow
```

**Monitor:**
- Validation step
- Version bump
- Commit step
- Fresh checkout
- Publication step

## 🔍 Debugging Guide

### Check Workflow Logs

```
https://github.com/dlnraja/com.tuya.zigbee/actions
```

**Look for:**
- ✅ Green checkmarks
- ❌ Red errors
- ⚠️ Yellow warnings

### Common Issues

#### Issue 1: "uncommitted changes"

**Cause:** Build artifacts not committed  
**Fix:** Already implemented in updated workflow (git add -A)

#### Issue 2: "HOMEY_PAT not found"

**Cause:** Secret not configured  
**Fix:** Follow Step 2 above

#### Issue 3: "validation failed"

**Cause:** App has SDK3 compliance issues  
**Fix:**
```bash
npx homey app validate --level publish
# Fix reported errors
```

#### Issue 4: "push rejected"

**Cause:** Protected branch or permissions  
**Fix:** Ensure `permissions: contents: write` in workflow
